I did not want to believe Kendrick won so I did a deep dive and I have came to the conclusion that Drake won for the reasons listed:

1. I listened to Drake's tracks more than Kendricks which means Drake did a better job
2. Drake had more beat switches which means he is more verse of tile in the rap game
3. Drake said the n word at the start of Family Matters after Kendrick said he couldn't and that made me laugh that was a good one.
4. Drakes house got shot up but Kendrick is safe and sound. So I need to give a bit of leeway to Drake in this scenario
5. Kendrick Lamar said Joel Ostean is an actor but he isn't.
6. Ebony King 2024 is not a real person
7. Anthony Fantano said drake lost, and he is always wrong and biased against drake so that means he won.
8. Drake used 2pacs ai voice because 2pac is dead, if 2pac was alive he would have gotten Pac. 9 . When drake gets on stage everyone throws their bras on the stage and when Kendrick gets on stage no bras get thrown. Kendrick is just jealous
9. Drake does not live in Atlanta so how is he a slave owner? Also he was born after slavery was aboleshed so Checkmate kendrick. That is a history lessen for yoo
10. Drake has better vibes then Kendrick overall so A+.

Do not discuss this below. I am right and Academiks agrees with me. Now time for some HENNY!

I've read multiple theories about the true reason behind Kenny and Drizzy beef, let's overview some of these theories

1-Drake hates Kenny because he didn't sign to OVO

I think there's def some truth to this but I highly doubt that it is the main motivation here, this incident dates back to 2012 but we've seen both artists together multiple times after that time, so I highly doubt that is the case.

2- Kendrick hates Drake because he fucked Baby Keem

Just like the previous theory, the timing is an important factor here, this incident happened in 2017 but in 2022 we saw Drake at Kendrick‚Äôs birth day party and we all know Kendrick has been with Mustard for quite a while and def doesn't think about Baby Keem anymore.

MY THEORY:

Honestly this might sound absurd at first but this thought came to my mind when listening to that gay bar in family matters, how does that mf Drake knows that Kendrick's music is played at gay bars, unless he himself has gone to these bars, now we have enough proof that he's gay, the rest is pretty easy, as a gay man Drake is attractive to handsome guys, and Kendrick is definitely very handsome and even though I'm not gay I have to admit he's got a nice ass as well, I totally see Drake asking Kendrick for sex but we XO know that Kendrick is straight so he has rejected Drake and this has caused the beef.

Again this might sound absurd and hard to believe but the more you think about it the more it makes sense.",False,False,Hiphopcirclejerk,THEORY: Drake is actually gay.

* They not like ‚Äúus‚Äù - referring to the movie US, where the father has a son AND a daughter. Drake has a son and daughter. The family is also clones, one of them isn‚Äôt real. 

* Deebo any rap nigga - Drake is known for not giving credit or royalties to his song writers, and Deebo stole $200 and didn‚Äôt give Smoky any of it. 

* Call the ambalamps tell em BREATH bro - referring to the Taylor swift song called Breathe where she says ‚ÄúIt's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend. Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me

* Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas - Drake ate a pop tart once and Kendrick is saying he could hide in drakes toaster and jump scare Drake anytime he wanted. 

* Pole on him - K Dot is saying he‚Äôs like Goku and would easily pull out his staff and pole vault over Drake in record sales or in mutual rap combat. 

* You better never go to cell block one - CB1 is short for Cannabinoid Receptor 1 meaning that Kendrick would inevitably out smoke Drake in a puff puff pass session. 

* Wop wop wop wop wop - this is a double meaning. Kendrick is saying Drake makes pop doo-wop music and also Drake wants to be Italian so Kenny calls Drake a slur for Italian Americans. 

* What is the owl? - Kendrick is saying ‚Äúwho is Drake?‚Äù But using an owl sound. Owls go hoo hoo hoo

* Since 2009 I had this bitch jumpin - in 2009 Kendrick was chatting with drakes fianc√©. Kendrick told her to bark like a dog and jump. She is still jumping til this day. 

* Niggas better straighten their posture - Kendrick knows Drake has acute spinal issues and has to sleep on a posturepedic brand bed to get a decent nights sleep. 

* Get polished - Kendrick knows some really tough guys in Poland and if Drake ever does a concert there, Kendrick‚Äôs friends will Polish him. 

*  How many stalks to I really have in stock? - Kendrick is very business wise and invests in agriculture. Kendrick owns stock in corn fields and they make him rich. He‚Äôs also calling Drake ‚Äúcorny‚Äù like corn stalks. Also, Kendrick climbed up the bean stalk and slayed the giant. 

* 1,2,3,4,5 plus 5 - Kendrick counted to ten. Drake is from ‚Äúthe six‚Äù. 10 minus 6 is 4. Drake excluded Kendrick from ‚Äúthe big 3‚Äù which makes Kendrick #1. 

* Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of za - Kendrick is saying he would figuratively bake drake like when you roll up pizza dough and cook it in the oven. 

* Once upon a time all of us was in chains - once upon a time is the name of a Disney tv show. Disney is known for  broken child actors becoming famous and losing their limelight. Drake was a child actor that spent money on owl necklace chains. Kendrick is also referring to how every culture had millions of slaves at one point, from the Mongolian empire, to Egypt, Persia, China, Japan, Africa, Mayans, Aztecs, etc.

He wanted to have ammo for the inevitable war between him and Kendrick. He planted that ""17"" year old so that his haters could think they had something to use against them. He was laying his trap card, Kendrick fell right into they trap.

There isn't even anything to say about Drake kissing the 17 years old because that girl has be in her 20s now anyways. Drake can't be charged with kissing a minor if, one she isn't minor in the time of the video. Two, if she isn't even a minor anymore. How can you kiss someone underage if they aren't even underage anymore?? 

That's not even the case though, really. Drake was ready for this beef years ago. He has slowly been laying traps for his haters. Kendrick is too short to realize this. He can't see them being set because he is too low to the ground. The girl in the crowd is actually 32. She actually has the same disease as Andy Milonakis so bringing this up and trying throw it back in Drake's face makes everyone abelist( j.cole??!) Especially Kendrick. 

You think he would understand the plight of not looking like a grown up do their size and stature. Tiny man, tiny tiny Kendrick, itty-bitty widdle Kendrick, liddle widdle kiddle Kendrick, wah-wah I can't get up onto the bed, mommy I need uppies Kendrick. Mommy Mommy look at the big puppy Kendrick.

I saw people saying that ""Damn"" was his best album so I bit. I never knew that this album had the bangers Humble, Love, and DNA; I always heard them on Madden or 2K. The way Kendrick tells his story makes you visualize everything with every bar.

Overall this album is a 10/10 and the best album I've heard to this day. For this to be released in 2017 and me not really listening to it after all these years, I should be in jailüò≠

edit: I have never listened to a Kendrick album in its entirety(not counting ""Damn"" obviously). So I have nothing to compare Damn to in his discography.

I remember seeing some comments debating if it could enter this weeks top 10, so #1 is crazy, but honestly not a surprise with how its been doing on streaming. And it looks like Not Like Us will actually have staying power, unlike Hiss which hit #1 from the Meg and Nicki beef and then kindve fell off after that. Also, that's two #1's for Kendrick in the span of one month. Song of the summer potential?

There is no such program or tech at least available to the public that can write and perform records that detailed‚Ä¶ so yes I wrote the song and produced the beat as well‚Ä¶ 

Here is the video!!!!


Ps‚Ä¶ I did this song to show off my talent, and I also did it because I honestly don‚Äôt think Kendrick will respond so I did the k dot fans a dam favor‚Ä¶

Essentially these three carve out the empire into three parts and becoming the ""BIG THREE"" of Rome.


Lepidus fell from power in 36BCE and essentially spent his life till 13BCE In relative peace.

While Augustus and Marc Antony were left to compete for control.
In this rivalry we see Augustus was almost always able to outsmart Marc Antony (partially because Marc Antony acted so rash) and was the reason for Marc's downfall.


In modern time
The Hip Hop Industry had 
Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and J. Cole.

Kendrick dissed J Cole but J Cole backed out and is living life out of spotlight.
Then Kendrick baited Drake into a diss and because of the evidences of Drake's rash behaviour, Kendrick basically ensured the downfall of Drake.


So we have one man who left the BIG THREE and basically is chilling ( Lepidus and J Cole)

One man who's stupid decisions left him open for criticisms ( Drake and Marc Antony)

I mean, if Drake hadn't ran his mouth and reignited this beef, imagine how many people would have never learned of how fucking sick Kendrick Lamar is? We would never have gotten Meet the Grahams or the summer's hip hop club bop that is Not Like Us. How many people would have never gone back and really appreciate how good good kid, m.A.A.d city, To pimp a butterfly and DAMN. are? After this is all said and done, I bet Drake was responsible for more new Kendrick Lamar fans since.... Kendrick Lamar.

I, myself, for example, knew Kendrick, but based on the songs I had heard had dismissed it as ""really good, but not for me"" - turns out I was just listening to the wrong songs! Turns out that, for example, I really just needed to listen to the other songs before m.A.A.d city, especially something like The Art of Peer Pressure, to really appreciate that banger!

So thank you, Drake, for committing social and professional suicide so more people would appreciate the real genius of Kendrick. You finally did something good for hip hop and the black community everywhere!

This has been the single craziest day of hip hop beefs. Their beef has been years in the making with tons of other details, but today specifically is just insane. 

Kendrick‚Äôs drops diss this morning, drake responds this evening saying Kendrick is on ozempic and beats his mixed wife, Kendrick responds with a diss like one hour later starting off with ‚ÄúDear Adonis (drakes son), I‚Äôm sorry that that man is your father‚Äù

Kendrick then just says drake should die: 

‚ÄúFuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose‚Äù

Then tells the world for the first time drake has a daughter he‚Äôs been hiding then calls him a narcissist misogynist and makes fun of his gambling streams and drinking problem. 

Overall crazy would love to see a deep dive. 

I‚Äôm doing a horrible job of explaining all the details but it‚Äôs so interesting.

And if Drake/Akademics don't do something by *Monday at noon*, then something is supposedly being released.

Seeing how invested Ethan is (as well as some others on the crew), I'm gonna take a pretty big guess that they'll be preoccupied at the start time. Even if it turns out to be nothing. It's definitely gonna be talked about though

**Contrarian And A 40 year Old Man**

A scholar and historian named Candice Owens has already exposed Destiny as an immature, disgusting, filthy and renowned Contrarian, never staking any REAL positions and always agreeing with the least popular position so he can be a debate paedophile and RAPE his opposing interlocutors even though it is clear to everyone that Kdot has lyrically raped Aubrey Graham. On top of that Anthony Fantano, Hasan Piker (Number 1 political streamer on twitch btw) and F.D Signifier all agree that Kendrick bodied drake, and knowing that history repeats itself; Ethan vs Hasan was used as a proxy war so Kendrick vs Drake will be used as a proxy war.

The worst part is that with the new knowledge from a credible source that claimed 'Destiny is pushing 40' since drake is a 37 year old man, who is also pushing 40, Destiny being a fraud will intrinsically feel like drake is a more relatable figure.

**Aba**

Aba is Canadian (sadly) unrelated but it's just a bit sad crodie.

**Not Black Enough To Say** ***nigga***

In the outro of the track 'Euphoria' Kendrick states ""We don't wanna hear you say nigga no more"" essentially telling Drake that he is not black enough no matter how hard he tries. Destiny has received the same criticism, even though he identifies as latinx (a group notoriously known for being avid nword sayers) but due to his light complexion he received criticism from his turkish, more successful, sexier, and knowledgeable peer (destiny had only gotten into politics for around 3 years at this point)  who told him he will never be black enough to say the nword and being the bitch he is, he took this to heart and never stopped hating that streamer and has been harrassing him for 5 years now.

As drake and destiny have essentially received the same discrimination, he'll feign ignorance to this obvious fact when reacting to the feud but secretly be rooting for drake in this debacle.

**Short**

Destiny and Kendrick being the same height would enable his deep rooted self hatred, making him ignore Kendrick's talent as he hates being short and hates minorities.

**Receives Hate Like Drake**

Destiny has always been the type of guy to let things go and wouldn't ever document the way he's been wronged, so seeing Kendrick call for the death of another human being would disgust him, and therefore as he's an emotional beta, he'll side with drake.

**Girls' Name**

Destiny, Aubrey. The alliance was predictable the from the moment  this knowledge was bestowed upon me.

**He's Cringe And Will Defend Drake's Attraction To Minors**

[It's sad that the lolicon would do the correct thing in this situation](https://preview.redd.it/2y4zekxf5pyc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=04b74a1ead12b505fe4306e2c7b5b0992b6f79c6)

As seen is this historical document above Destiny would continue to stupidly defend drake and claim that there's 'not enough evidence to call drake a pedo he's an ephebophile at best' when we all know Drake loves em young!

Destiny would then disregard all Kendrick diss tracks claiming that it isn't 'interesting' and there's no substantial 'evidence' when we all know from the evidence I provided, he'd be 100% team drake, but just deny it.

**Racism And I/P**

As Destiny is a certified RACIST, who's claimed he says the nword WEEKLY, when not being allowed by real black people like F.D signifier, and Kendrick, ( I can't add Aba into this as F.D is messiah and said he wasn't a real black man) which shows where his allegiance will lie. It lies with Big Ak and the coloniser Drake, who colonised the rap industry and is also half Jewish, and guess what country Destiny supports? Do I even need to say anymore I believe I've made my case already.

As Hasan would say ""This Gusano should not be able to have input on this conflict as he will undoubtably choose to be on the wrong side of history as he did with the Palestinian Genocide, may they rest in power ‚ù§ ""

*In all seriousness why does he just not react, even if he doesn't care its like 30 mins of songs to listen to inshallah the easiest views of all time Wallahi*

I remember a couple months ago listening to Mutahar talk to someone (maybe turkey tom) about tickle gate situation with the minecraft streamer and the ""freshly 18"" girl who 6 months later decided to accuse the guy of sexual assault for him tickling her. They were talking about whether or not he knew she was her age or not because she may have had a 21+ wrist band. Something he said made a lot of sense that as a public figure he would never even be in the same room as a minor drinking, even if it was someone like turkey tom, because as a public figure, even an unsubstantiated allegation of any misconduct could have huge ramifications. Protect your career at all times, because as a public figure there are many risks that come along with that.

As a jr camp counselor at this jewish summer camp I went to (I know, shocker, a dgger jewlumni) when I was 15 I remember being told I could never be in the same as one of the campers EVER. This was not just because they wanted to protect the kids but also to protect the camp itself and us as the counselors. I believe teachers follow the same rules. Nothing can go wrong if you aren't in a situation that could wrong to begin with. As we know with the ticklegate situation, even ""freshly"" 18 year olds can interpret things much differently. A thing Drake said or did in good faith could suddenly come back to haunt him. We are dealing with emotionally undeveloped brains here.

A 14 year old could say something that gets interpreted incorrectly, face pressure from parents or peers to say something, or just want money. These are all the things that could wrong when the adult is NOT acting inappropriately. When you add the things that could wrong when they DO, then it makes sense why so many people think it is inappropriate. Intent doesn't matter here because when it's two people it will always be a he said/she said. Therefore, it will be up to people to decide themselves. But one thing they will ALWAYS assign blame to is it will always come down to the adult knowing they should have avoided being in that situation to begin with , guilty or not.

Drake is very lucky all these girls he texted as kids are defending him, but as we can see even with that he is facing scrutiny. Imagine if one had claimed he did something highly inappropriate. Even if they were lying he would be toast. Being in these situations is extremely risky and reckless. Not to mention there is power dynamic at play, someone they look up to. It would be very easy to disprove grooming allegations if you never texted the person to begin with. Why is drake willing to put himself in these irresponsible situations over and over again? Optics really is everything, too many points on a graph and it creates a line, and now kendrick is using that line publicly hang him with. You reap what you sow, and these blackberries arent as juicy and sweet as kendricks... (ok that was corny and weirdly erotic, ill leave the song title references to kdot and drizzy, I couldnt help myself)

So when I say Drake is irresponsible and inappropriate in texting these minors, him being a public figure only makes it more so, and this is all while still giving him the benefit of the doubt on not being a groomer or worse. However, if this is the best interpretation, now lets realize most people don't operate under the best interpretation, and he should know that before doing these things. He could have avoided ALL of this by applying the same logic teachers and counselors do and trying to avoid 1 on 1 interactions with minors alone or in private conversations as much as possible.

Sorry Destiny, you don't get the luxury of not caring what people think of you in these situations when you are a public figure, because optics can kill your career, but intentions won't save it.

Edit: I‚Äôm not saying anyone‚Äôs a pedo, just that it‚Äôs irresponsible to text minors as a public figure about these situations. I would never be in the hypothetical situation destiny mentioned about a 14 girl asking me if she can get pregnant having sex with boyfriend in a hot tub. If they feel that comfortable texting that I believe boundaries were already crossed. Also none of you guys are public figures. No one read anything I wrote and are strawmanning the fuck out this.

Hasan is Drake: Big mainstream appeal, waters down genre (hip-hop/politics) to make it appealing to mainstream audiences, while losing the substance in the process. Subliminally sneak disses Destiny (Kendrick) over time without even naming him.

Destiny is Kendrick: Less mainstream appeal but still big in the game (hip-hop/stream politics). Anyone who really cares about the genre is a fan of him for the actual quality, and smart takes (introspective rap).

Vaush is J. Cole: Third big figure who a lot wouldn't consider part of the big three, yet is in here. Small cultish audience. Is a bum. Corny as fuck.

Whether the content is true or not didn't matter as much as the presentation which ultimately lead to why Kendrick is widely accepted as the winner of the battle.

This is why understanding the art of debate is important, because you have to know how to get the hearts and minds of (engage) people. If you don't, what you say doesn't have as big of an impact if any.

Keep in mind: what's decade defining and what were actually the biggest/most successful hip-hop songs of the 2010s is completely different. This is a combination of success but also cultural impact, discourse, how influential they were in and out of hip-hop, etc. What rap songs do you feel defined the last decade from 2010 to 2019?

For me: this are the 20 that immediately came to mind. I'm very curios on what other songs you feel made the 2010s.

21 Savage - a lot

1. The We Can't Trust You album bomb has hit Canada! I have never been a Future fan but something about Kendrick (who I adore) dissing Drake just amuses me to no end lol, which is good because Like That has debuted at #1!! That being said, the only other Future x Metro Boomin song to make the top 10 is Type Shit. However, these are not the only new songs in the top 10. Too Sweet by Hozier debuted at #4!! This is his highest charting song in the country since Take Me to Church which peaked at #2 over a decade ago. Multi-week chart topper Beautiful Things still holds on dropping only to #2. Here is the full top 10:
   1. Future and Metro Boomin' feat. Kendrick Lamar - Like That (NEW)
   2. Beautiful Things (-1)
   3. Lose Control (-1)
   4. Hozier - Too Sweet (NEW)
   5. Stick Season (+1, previous peak of #3, excited to see him live in less than a week!!)

   2. \#32: Vampire (+2, debuted at #1 last year)
   3. \#37: Artemas - I Like the Way You Kiss Me (NEW, obsessed with this song!! Will probably peak in the top 10 somewhere based on how well it's doing on streaming, also chart debut!!)

He also predicted this current beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar which is the relevant bit of this post. Kendrick has recently called Drake a pedophile and sex trafficker on his recent diss tracks, which is what caused people to catch wind of this site.

Even the usually clueless Buzzfeed commenters were calling out the fact that the article purposefully didn't reference what is the MAIN focus of all of the back and forth between the two guys, which basically amounts to Kendrick Lamar very publicly calling Drake out as a pedo, and Drake making the weirdest/insane defense of the accusation that I've ever heard of, which basically amounts to ""I planted the source of your information (that I'm a pedo), so it was all really a fun prank orchestrated by me!

Kendrick Lamar, Katt Williams, and Kanye West have all been very vocal recently as they all know the true extent and how deep this all goes. 

Before this beef, it was widely known Drake was a pedophile. From texting 13-year-old girls to feeling young women on stage to leaking him having sex, to etc etc. 

But what is glossed over is the extent of this pedophilia,  extortion, and utter debauchery.

Drake is the largest person in the music industry, the golden boy of Universal Music Group, and infinitely bank-rolled by them. Similar to Diddy, he‚Äôs an industry extortionist, vulture but ultimately a low-level player compared to who he serves. Diddy being low-level, compared to Cohan and Grange, still is powerful enough to make people disappear and have the LAPD on their payroll. 

 Lucian Grange, head of UMG, has been already named in a lawsuit and excused for sexual assault. 

Lucian also has connections to the IMF and World Banking, most notably getting involved in enslaving Africa in Debt.

UMG is owned by BlackRock, Safe Street, Vanguard, etc. Not only do these men, rape and pillage the land for their resources and capital, but they also literally rape in pillage the land from kids who are then sexually trafficked and forgotten about.

But we all know that.

The emperor truly has no clothes, our rulers are pedophiles, our musicians make millions of degrading women then extorting them in real life‚Ä¶ 

Only to get raided by the FBI‚Ä¶ who suppress the evidence because they‚Äôve been bankrolling it the whole time‚Ä¶

Maybe people won‚Äôt realize the elites and celebrities kidnap foreign children and breed children for the sole purpose of sexual assault and discreet disposability, but maybe realizing their favorite artist is a pedophile will unveil something.

What I‚Äôm saying it could be a distraction from is Lucian Grainge‚Äôs (CEO of UMG) name being dropped in the Lil Rod lawsuit against Diddy. I‚Äôm sure we all know by now the things Diddy is being accused of by several people. The most notable were Cassie and Lil Rod. Lil Rod in his lawsuit claimed that Lucian aiding and abetting Diddy with his illegal sexual activities. 

It‚Äôs important to note and remember that you couldn‚Äôt go anywhere without not hearing about Diddy and the things that people have been accusing him of. We even saw that people in the royal family were pictures alongside him in the past. News of Diddy and about Diddy was everywhere. At the height of all of the scandals, Lucian Grainge‚Äôs name started being mentioned in blogs, pages, social media as people started to learn he was mentioned in the lawsuit.

So is it just a coincident that after Lucian asked the court to dismiss the claims made against him made in this lawsuit, that two of the biggest rappers in the world, both having deals with UMG, started beefing out of nowhere? Granted, they do have some history of not getting along but still. Did anyone even think they would be going at each other in this manner?

Crazy part is now no one is talking about Diddy or the lawsuits against him. All of that news has hushed. Not to mention the 2 Boeing whistleblowers who mysteriously died after coming out and exposing that the planes were faulty and that the working environment has been chaotic.

Diddy's exposure (not of himself, this time).

https://preview.redd.it/uq4qzgxrtisc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f5ffb38aee0c3b2b41312220df1f7ee05013b9e

P. Diddy seems to be just the beginning of key figures in the music industry getting caught for doing horrendous things, using their power and influence over new comers and less influential people in the music industry. One name that has repeatedly been brought up in relation to Diddy has been Sir Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Studios.

We're all familiar with Kendrick Lamar and his ability and tendency to make music with deep underlying meaning. Across Kendrick's album TPAB, Kendrick refers to someone as ""Lucy."" This reference for years has been commonly taken as a reference to Lucifer or the devil. However, listening to the song For Sale? - Interlude following these dark music industry revelations, makes me think Lucy refers to Lucian Grainge. If Kendrick were to openly talk about the dark influence a powerful person like sir Lucian Grainge holds over the music industry, Kendrick would undoubtedly do it in a way where it could have alternate interpretations.

Looking at the lyrics, nothing regarding ""Lucy"" alludes or relates to the Devil or any biblical evil. The lyrics actually seem to describe an influential and powerful figure in the music industry, who appears to have bad intentions and seeks to manipulate a fresh young talent (Kendrick) entering the music industry.

Allegations regarding sex trafficking that are surrounding Diddy and Lucian appear to commonly include music industry parties, where many celebrities named in the Epstein case make appearances. It was put on record that Lucian attended every single one of these parties. Which is why I highlighted the lyrics ""avoiding me? Is not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly.""

The lyrics to For Sale? - Interlude by Kendrick seem to fit Lucian Grainge as the character ""Lucy"" more than if it was referring to Lucifer. If Kendrick was actually referring to Lucian Grainge, from 2015, what has been going on behind the scenes since 2015 until 2024 (now) that have lead to P. Diddy and Lucian Grainge being connected to a huge sex trafficking operation?

Also this is based off of nothing but what if this is why X was killed?  Discovered drakes daughter since they both were in the same general part of Florida and word got around?  Pure speculation but fun nonetheless. 

Also idk if anyone is following this ebonyprince account, but there is some strong references to sexual abuse by drake and his crew, as well as some stuff with Christopher Alvarez and some very unsettling reports regarding drake and dogs 

Would love some discussion as my post was removed elsewhere

And that there‚Äôs weird shit going on in the industry. It got me thinking that everything is really a way to oversexualize, groom, and overpower children. Think about it why is there so many goddamn movies/ tv shows/ music videos that take place in a high school setting? Ex. Sexxy redd performing at a hs. Why not a college, where her music is more, idk appropriate for those ages of people? Me personally, I just think that this ‚Äúhyper sexuality‚Äù or yk whatever you want to call it, is basically a way to get kids/ teens, to think and act sexually. also basically to not have discernment when an adult is acting inappropriately towards them. i.e. grooming. Ice spice having a whole minor twerking with her ass out in her deli mv is just another example. They bring these artists/ podcasters/ vloggers, and etc. to basically sell and promote sex. Grown men or women preying on underage boys/girls. and tbh I dont like the popularization of, or even support only fans. People (men/ women) making 100k+ or 1mill + just for recording themselves, and all the while there are people who are really trapped in that lifestyle (human trafficking victims) and photos and videos of them are being passed around without their consent, or even knowledge. Yes, these kids see it, bs soon as they turn 18, they‚Äôre making an of page.

I believe dreams are a realm that crises over to the demon realm where they live. Somewhat of a bridge between to realities.

I‚Äôve heard of some people who go to war with demons in dreams.

You know like running away from something terrifying and you wake up? I think that‚Äôs when we realise demons are about and become self aware in the dream state.

Sometimes when I become aware, everyone turns and looks at me and then a ‚Äúsecurity guard‚Äù will come to me and ‚Äúkill me‚Äù and I will wake up.

Another two times, I became aware in a dream and both times I ‚Äúkept my cool‚Äù.
Once, I become aware and I was walking around until I saw two strangers who were demons and they looked like humans, and I pretended to be unaware. First they were shocked that they found me wondering around myself but as I stood still and waited for orders, they did something to me which made me walk and I went into this room and started to perform oral on a girl‚Ä¶. But the kicker is, that girl was a real girl who was also dreaming.

The other time I became aware, I realised I was in a ‚Äúsex house/warehouse‚Äù where women who were dreaming where being used for their ovaries? Or something and the males for their speed? I don‚Äôt know, but they were doing sexual a things to us.

This is what many alien abductees also speak about. Being sexually ‚Äúviolated/explored/used‚Äù.

I believe aliens and demons are the same thing.

Many myths and religions talk about female demons and male demons that come to you and take your sperm or impregnate you. Succubus and succubi.

Most of the time we do not remember dreams and I think this is a bad sign, meaning they do whatever they want to us and we don‚Äôt even know. 

I believe nightmares are when we become aware in the most vulnerable situations and we see the demonic faces and what they are doing to us.

I think we need to understand the correlation between ‚Äúaliens‚Äù and ‚Äúdemons‚Äù and the dream realm and the dimension in our reality from which they come from. 

The Aline ufos ‚Äúblip in‚Äù out of no where. This is because they are in a dimension right here next to us.

I believe the governments all know about this. 

I believe there are demons, and then there are also the good kind of beings, and they are both at war,. Which I cannot prove.

I believe governements have chosen sides with either the good side or the bad side.

The bad side require us to do immoral things in exchange for technology and weapons or knowledge or scientific discoveries. On an individual level occultist do immoral things personally to gain money or love, but most rightfully shy away from doing major imooral things like human sacrifice. Many celebereites will sacrifice goats and chickens for fame and money and that‚Äôs out in the open. Behind close doors, the people who own the artists are said to have women they use as breeders for children that no one knows about, and they can do whatever they want to these kids. Some are grown into sex slaves and some are sacrificed, some are current leaders in the world and we don‚Äôt even know it. Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs label manager lucien is working for a Rothschild family member. I don‚Äôt like to mention that as many people think it‚Äôs conspiratorial, but it‚Äôs literally common knowledge now. 

The demons control the music industry through this method, and the movie industry through similar methods. Everything is coming out, jot only because it‚Äôs hard to keep things like this hidden, but I actually think the demons want everyone to know for some reason. I think maybe they want us all to fear them, or some other reason.

What I know for sure is the more moral and clean you are, the more demons run away from you, the more immoral and unclean you are, the more easily they use you and abuse you. 

I‚Äôve hard Oprah has underground fasciitis‚Äôs where she has women that she uses to bear children for her sacrifices.

I am claiming every area in society that has power and control within it is compromised and that all celebrities are jot only involved, but it‚Äôs the very way they became rich and powerful.

Have any of you considered that at least some of the conspiracy theories out there are put in place to distract you from the real issues?

How do you critically engage with your theories? Do you even do that? How can you be sure that you're right if you don't consider the fact that you're wrong?

I'm not trying to be a postmodernist that destabilises the ideas of objective truth and meaning, but we live in a postmodernist information age, where disinformation, propaganda and ideology are the norm. The internet is full of different perspectives on life, politics and the world. 

The media loves this new turn. It loves to stoke the fire. A culture war is just what they need. Your anger and hate towards people on the other side fuels the media. Instead of presenting the facts and events, we are presented with polarised opinions about said events. People get a thrill watching the news where people engage in heated arguments. We become addicted to news outlets, relying on them to shape our worldviews instead of reading a book.

Politicians love this too. They love dividing us. The best way to get the majority's votes is to divide the country (usually into two) by targeting one group and supporting the supremacy of the other. This happens in the US and in India. When we vote, we are presented with a binary choice where one party is useless (Democrat and Congress) and the other is populist and bordering on fascism (Republican and BJP). It appears that these two sides are against each other but the reality is that they have so much in common. They are both puppets of the people with real power: the people with the money.

And that brings us to corporations. Corporations will play all sides, support everyone. They pander to the LGBTQ community, not because they actually care but because they can make money off of it. They also pander to those reactions to the LGBTQ community, like on Facebook, because anger and hate bring more views and clicks.

**This is my conspiracy theory: the rich puppet the world, their strings are everywhere, and all institutions in our society either consolidate their control or distract us from their control by peddling conspiracy theories.**

This is a comprehensive post regarding Drake's extremely questionable behavior regarding minors and young women in general. There's more than 70 links in this post to various sources and over 30.000 characters.

If you want to repost, make a YouTube video, an article, a TikTok or Twitter thread then do it - I do not need credit, I do not care - I only want this information to be spread. 

This post will serve as an archive that people can refer back to or use as a source to back up their claims. 

Let me be clear - I do not like Drake. I've thought the guy was a creep ever since the Millie Bobby Brown video and I despise him - but I'll still try to remain as objective as possible here, you know my bias now though.

**[THE 17 YEAR OLD AT A SHOW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp5b9dW1nrA)** 

Drake is performing at a show in Ogden, Denver where he calls a girl up on stage. I really encourage you to watch this yourself, but since I know the majority of you won't watch it, I've described it for you below.

Video starts with her on stage, he asks her name, where she is from, asks the crowd to welcome her to the stage and tells her she looks great. He then asks her to give him two seconds because ""I gotta be ready for you"". 

He wipes off his sweat with a towel and proceeds to take her hand, put it on his shoulder, his hand on her hip/back and they slow dance for a few seconds. He spins her around and stop her with her back facing him. This is when it starts to get.. really weird. 

Drake says ""I told you I like your hair, right, what is it, like herbal essence or something?"" while he's caressing her shoulder and smelling her hair. He says something I can't hear properly, puts the mic down and exposes her upper back and neck by pulling her shirt collar down. The crowd goes wild. He then starts kissing her shoulder and neck, putting her arms around her and fondle her breast. 

A few seconds later he picks up the mic again and says ""you can't have me carried away again before I get in trouble - how old are you?"" She responds ""17"". The crowd has a mixed reaction - Drake says something that is hard to make out, because of the crowd but when it's clear he says ""I can't go to jail yet, man - 17? Why do you look like that? You thick - look at all this!"" 

It's hard to make out exactly what he says afterwards because of the poor quality (2011 zoomed video at a concert, it's bad..), but he says something about it bringing them (the 17 year old and Drake) to a close and follows it up with ""I got one question for you (...) I just want to know if (something about women in Colorado), I should just take one opportunity to take one home?"" 

The girl nods ""As a Colorado woman you'd enjoy that?"" ""Well, listen 17, I had fun - I don't know if I should feel guilty or not, but I had fun. I liked the way your breasts felt against my chest. I just want to thank you."" He then puts the mic down again, grabs her hand and kisses it. You might think that was a little over the top, but he then immediately follows it up by putting his hand on her chin and kissing both of her cheeks, her forehead and then on **her fucking lips**. 

I think he asks her to walk off stage, it's hard to make out, but then he says ""It's okay. I'm only 23, I can do shit like that. It's all good, you know what I'm saying"" and the video ends. 

*Addition: I know this girl has said she was not offended, violated, whatever you want to call it, but that's not the point. And I do not mean to sound like a complete dick, but it's not about her - it's about Drake and proving his pattern of behavior over many instances. If you stopped here because she denied it, you completely missed the point.*

Drake's age: 23

**MILLIE BOBBY BROWN**

Now [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZPKh74Li8) was what really made me do a double take on Drake. Now, there's one very important fact to establish here and that is that Millie Bobby Brown at the time of this interview (18. September 2018) is 14 (Born 19. February 2004). I'll quickly transcribe the interview here: 

Interviewer: 

>What about your relationship with Drake, tell me about your friendship, how did this all come about? 

Millie Bobby Brown: 

>I love him. I met him in Australia and he's honestly so fantastic and a great friend and a great role model. You know we text - we just texted each other the other day and he was like ""I miss you so much"" and I was like ""I miss you more"". He's coming to Atlanta, so I'm definitely gonna go and see him and I'm so excited. 

Interviewer 2: 

>You and Drake? That's awesome. That's awesome.. 

Interviewer: 

>What advice does he give you? What does he say? 

MMB: 

>About boys he helps me, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah he's great. He's wonderful, I love him. 

Interviewer: 

>What's his advice with boys? 

MMB: 

>Ehm, you know.. That stays in the text messages. 

I'm sure it's obvious what is wrong here and I don't need to spell it out for any of you, but I do have one thing to add. If Drake is giving advice about boys and telling her ""I miss you so much"" they must have talked for a while. It's not something you say after knowing a person for a week. We are talking months at least. There's 7 months between her birthday and the interview - did Drake already start talking to her when she was 13? It would make sense that Drake was in Australia during their summer (Dec-Feb) for festivals/concerts/vacation. 

Millie has only commented on this once which was a few days later in a story on [Instagram](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/09/210592/millie-bobby-brown-defends-friendship-with-drake)

I don't want or mean to infantilize her, but she was 14. She would have no chance of knowing if Drake actually was grooming her. There's not a chance that she could understand the dynamic at play and why it's wrong at that age. 

Drake also defended their friendship on the song [*Another Late Night*](https://genius.com/Drake-another-late-night-lyrics) when he raps: 
>Weirdos in my comments talkin' 'bout some Millie Bobby, look

>Bring them jokes up to the gang, we get to really flockin'

Ironically enough that very same song is also connected to the next person

Drake's age: 33

**BILLIE EILISH** 

The year after the Millie Bobby Brown controversy Drake gets caught texting a minor again and this time it's Billie Eilish. She does a yearly interview with Vanity Fair, and in the [2019 version](https://youtu.be/YltHGKX80Y8?t=97) she's asked who's her most famous contact in her phone. That's when she reveals she's been texting with Drake and that he's so very nice to her. Billie is at the time of the interview (released 25. November 2019) 17 (born 18. December 2001). 

Billie did defend Drake and their texting in an [interview with Vogue ~3 months later](https://www.vogue.com/article/billie-eilish-cover-march-2020):
>‚ÄúThe internet is such a stupid-ass mess right now,‚Äù says Eilish, who quit Twitter in 2018. ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs so sensitive. A grown man can‚Äôt be a fan of an artist? There are so many people that the internet should be more worried about. Like, you‚Äôre really going to say that Drake is creepy because he‚Äôs a fan of mine, and then you‚Äôre going to go vote for Trump? What the fuck is that shit?‚Äù

On the song [*Another Late Night*](https://genius.com/Drake-another-late-night-lyrics) where Drake mentions Millie Bobby Brown, Lil Yachty is featured (one of Drake's gho.. co-writers) and he raps the line:
> I let her go, she fine as hell but baby wasn't stylish (Yeah)

>She had big tits like Billie Eilish but she couldn't sing (Drip)

Now - I know this is not Drake, I just thought it was a 'funny' coincidence that these two women are connected through their shared experiences with Drake and this song. On another note some might say that Drake should have asked Yachty to omit this line if he really was a friend of Billie Eilish since she has been quite vocal about sexualization of herself and women in general.

Drake's age: 34

**BELLA HARRIS** 

This one is pretty fucking bad in my opinion. Bella Harris is the daughter of [Jimmy Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Jam_and_Terry_Lewis) who's a record producer, songwriter etc. and has been very successful. Through him she's been in and around the entertainment/music business her whole life and met Drake that way. 

There's an archive of [photos posted here](https://www.kanyetothe.com/threads/drake-and-bella-harris-timeline.8088605/) that contains the old IG posts she had with Drake. The first one was on May 5th, 2016 - Bella Harris is born 20. April, 2000. She had just turned 16 at the time. 

Objectively I think they are defendable since they are all music related - Rihanna concert, Summer Sixteen Tour (ironic name..) and the American Music Awards, but then two years later they [reportedly start dating](https://www.wmagazine.com/story/bella-harris-who-is-drake-girlfriend) and that makes it really difficult to believe, especially with the last archived photo of them in 2018. Also the same photo that is referenced in [this article](https://www.eonline.com/news/968171/drake-and-rumored-girlfriend-bella-harris-enjoy-intimate-dinner) talking about Drake renting an entire restaurant for an intimate dinner between them. 

Note that E! have confirmed it and are not backing down on their claim despite Harris denying it on Instagram. 

Her father liked [this post on Instagram](https://twitter.com/youraverag1/status/1787522453004071047) about the whole situation. It's not particular to the restaurant or previous potential dating it's more so a general declaration of support for Drake, but that includes the PDF-file allegations. 

Him supporting Drake made me search for more information, because I wanted to find whether or not he had spoken about it at the time. [That led me to this article](https://www.startribune.com/jimmy-jam-s-daughter-s-an-anti-kardashian/303679711/) where her mother, Lisa, is being asked a few questions regarding Bella. 

> I was surprised Jimmy Jam hasn't introduced Bella to Drake, Rihanna or anybody else in the music world she is interested in meeting.

>""No,"" said Lisa. ""She loves Rihanna, she loves Beyonc√©. [Bella has met Bey; her brother Max has met Ri-Ri.] She hasn't met Drake. Too old.""

Lisa Harris about a photo of Bella (included in the article) - Bella is 14, almost 15 at the time.

>I think Drake would behave himself around a child, even one dressed like this, to wit: Mom doesn't think this photo is too sexy, in all its legginess?

>""SHE'S WEARING A BATHING SUIT and a coat!"" said Lisa. ""Sexy? What? My point is it's a body business, so I don't look at it [that way]. It's a posed picture. She has a one-piece bathing suit on. It's artistic.""

Drake's age: 29-31

**KYLIE JENNER**

Ever since the Kanye (also fuck Kanye for the record) vs. Drake beef we (or I at least) became aware of the fact that Drake has had a long relationship with the Kardashians/Jenners and known them for many, many years. In fact [Drake performed at Kylie's sweet 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWX-I6n-AQg) back in 2013. You know what that Sweet 16 was specifically remembered for as well? [Drake kissing Kylie on the cheek in front of everyone, including her then boyfriend Jaden Smith](https://hollywoodlife.com/2013/08/19/kylie-jenner-drake-kiss-sweet-sixteen-birthday-party/). 

That's not out of the ordinary and would be 'normal', if it wasn't for the clear pattern that is going on here, because guess what - 6 years later Drake and Kylie [reportedly start dating](https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-drake-spending-romantic-time-together/), well.. dating/fucking/whatever you wanna call it. Admittedly this article is easily dismissed as paparazzi journalism and clickbait, but what if I told you that Drake has rapped this: 

> Yeah, I‚Äôm a hater to society/Real shit, Kylie Jenner that‚Äôs a side piece/Yeah, I got 20 muthafuckas in‚Äô Kylies.

You probably wouldn't have heard it, since it was on an [unreleased track played on an Instagram Live back in 2020](https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.56014/title.drake-does-damage-control-after-referring-to-kylie-jenner-as-a-side-piece-on-old-song), but it does make it seem pretty likely that he did actually hook up with her, especially considering the response Drake posted 

>‚ÄúA song that mark ran last night on night owl sound live set shouldn‚Äôt have been played,‚Äù he wrote, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a song that leaked 3 years ago and got scrapped shortly after. He was just going too deep in the drake/future catalogue. Last thing I‚Äôd want to do is wake up having any friends of mine feeling disrespected so I just had to say that to start off the day.‚Äù

Kylie was 22 at the time they reportedly hooked up.

Drake's age at Kylie's Sweet 16: 26

Drake's age when they hooked up: 33

**HAILEY BALDWIN (NOW BIEBER)**


In 2016 there were [reports](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3619439/Drake-Hailey-Baldwin-spark-dating-rumours-party-early-hours-following-claims-got-cosy-Memorial-Day-bash.html) that Hailey and Drake were dating. Apparently [they hooked up at a party](https://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/celebrity-news/drake-enjoys-cosy-date-hailey-8096688) that Drake hosted, where another attendee is also mentioned that seems oddly relevant: 

>Drake and Hailey weren't the only ones getting close, with Kylie Jenner and rumoured new boyfriend PartyNextDoor were seen ""making out"" at the party.

>""It was almost like she was trying to make a statement,"" an insider added.

Now again - there's nothing illegal in a 11 year age difference and dating a 19-year old as 30. It's weird, yes. But again we come back to the *pattern*. Why do Drake know Hailey? Through their similar friends and friend group (Kardashians/Jenners). How long has Drake known Hailey? Well, when Hailey was 19, she said they [had known each other for a long time](https://www.eonline.com/news/774104/hailey-baldwin-opens-up-about-great-friend-drake). 

We can actually get even closer with certainty since we know that [Hailey attended Kylie's Sweet 16](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kylie-jenner-sweet-16-birthday-drake-big-sean-jaden-smith-attend-2013188/) in August, 2013. Hailey is born 22. November 1996, so she was also 16 at the time. So it's another girl that Drake has known since she was a minor and started dating when he got the opportunity. This is not normal.

Another pattern that Drake also seem to follow is that likes to hook up with his friends girl. We know for a fact that he hooked up with Lil Wayne's girlfriend while he was in prison. He not only rap about it, but also admit it [in an interview](https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/video-of-lil-wayne-talking-about-drakes-alleged-involvement-with-his-gf-resurfaces-after-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-1302605). It's not really hard to believe that he did the same with Bieber. 

Drake's age at Kylie's Sweet Sixteen: 26

Drake's age when they hooked up: 29

**CYDNEY CHRISTINE (LIL CC)** 

Cydney Christine is a beatmaker and model - she produced the Drake song *Money In The Grave* and in a [Complex interview/roundtable she talks about it and Drake.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGkhGNWBMlA) 

>Really the only artist I reached out to is Drake. I'd never met him, never spoke to him, I don't know why, but he has been following me for the past like 6 years. I don't know why.. 

This interview was uploaded 17. December 2019, Cydney Christine's is born 21. July, 1997, meaning she was 22 at the time of the interview and 15-16 when Drake started following her. This is somewhat innocent but strange since Drake is 27 at the time. That's not what is really weird though. 

In [March 2023, Lil CC is on the No Jumper podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AovnZW76D4) and here she speaks about Drake and having her debut beat being a Drake single. 

Lil CC: I played basketball, right, so he really was a fan or not a fan, sorry, supported one of my teammates at the time um.. 

Adam 22: And this is when you are in high school?

Lil CC: Yeah, in high school. So he was a fan of women's basketball - high school basketball - I was her teammate so he followed me because of her, and I was like ""oh shit, bitch, you got Drake to follow me, like what the hell? Like that's so crazy"". So he followed me and I lost it - I have to meet Drake, I love Drake, I've always loved Drake, still love Drake.

There's more to the conversation, but the relevant part is here is that it's just very, very strange for Drake to be a ***women's high school basketball fan***. They are 16 at the time. He's a supporter of a 16 year old female high school basketball player as a 27 year old grown adult man. He has not hooked up with her, dated or anything of the sorts that we know of or that she has told - for the record.

Drake's age: ~27

___

**AALIYAH**

It's not like I have whole section for this, but his obsession with Aaliyah is just another part of the pattern. I don't have a lot to contribute here, but if you don't know Aaliyah's story I'd recommend reading her [Wikipedia and specifically the section about her personal life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaliyah). If you think that 'obsession' is too strong a word for how much Drake admires her, I think you should take a look at this [Complex article from 2018](https://www.complex.com/music/a/andrew-martin/a-history-of-drakes-obsession-with-aaliyah) and reconsider.

**UNCONFIRMED STORIES**

(*I will continuously update it whenever I find or get sent new information to add here.*)

- Back in 2021 Drake was being exposed on TikTok for his 'private Tinder' where [one of his guys would go out and the hottest girls in town, interview them and find the one that Drake would like the best](https://raptv.com/news/drake-blasted-on-tiktok-for-rumors-regarding-a-private-tinder/). 

>‚ÄúHe finds the girls and then he interviews them, and out of all the girls he interviews, he picks the one that he thinks is the best,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThen, he drives her to Drake‚Äôs place, Drake has sex with her, and then he drives her home. So, basically, Drake has his own private Tinder.‚Äù

- This [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/1clik1f/a_personal_story_about_drakes_love_for_minors/) - yes I know this is 'so easy to just say', but I think the poster was very right by pointing this out: 

>I'm sure you guys won't believe me, but this is the type of situation where someone vanishing and telling you is the best you'll get.

- [This YouTube comment](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fr5v9o16cwgyc1.jpeg) about a girl claiming to be a victim of trafficking in Toronto in 2015 and that Drake had ties in all these circles.

**(DIS)HONORABLE MENTION**

I know people say Jorja Smith, and I do agree that [dating a 19-year old as a 30-year old man](https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/drake-secretly-hooking-up-walsall-10188046) is weird and rather pathetic, but every other girl mentioned is related to minors. Their relationship if you can call it that was for sure toxic, and it seems like Drake was a piece of shit abusing the power dynamic between them. This is taken from the Drizzy subreddit, but I can't provide the source since that gets the post blacklisted as it's temporarily banned because of brigading.  

> In ‚ÄúSummer Games‚Äù Drake also says ‚ÄùI kept it decent, even the secrets, kept it between you and I‚Äù. What secrets exactly? Well in Jaded, Drake says this woman ‚Äútold him all her insecurities‚Äù.

>It‚Äôs also interesting that the song ‚ÄúSummer Games‚Äù is about a woman who broke up with Drake right at the beginning of the summer. Drake and Jorja were dating in April of 2017 which is right before the summer starts and only lasted a couple weeks.

But that's all there is to it. I can't dig up anything else, so unless someone have something credible with sources, I don't think there's good enough reason to add her to the list further up.

**FINAL NOTE**

I know there's very real questions about the reliability of CDAN and that he was [exposed](https://www.thedailybeast.com/crazy-days-and-nights-blogger-unmasked-as-john-nelsonby-ex-mistress-cassandra-crose), but in the very same article The Daily Beast refers back to one of [their old articles on the subject](https://www.thedailybeast.com/whos-next-the-mysterious-blind-item-king-who-exposed-weinstein-spacey-and-lauer-before-the-media) which definitely confirms that he had/have industry ties and do know a lot. Another reddit user dove further in and made some [compelling arguments](https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/1cmm2vi/how_legit_are_the_damning_blind_items_a_deep_dive/?share_id=DlN8ljX4ZZ7O3eXmI4V3A), but remember to take it with a (big) grain of salt. 

If you have anything to add, please post it in the comments and if credible/sourced I'll put it in the post. If I got anything wrong please correct me and I'll edit it. If you have sources that contradict anything in the post, please also share them with me and I'll include them.

## Timeline of events since March 2024
Note: This is not an attempt to give you an historical overview of the direct and indirect back-and-forth between the artists involved. For an overview of the decade-long build up, see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3zxk3/drake_vs_the_world_megathread/kzl9sf6/) by u/Iminlesbian, which starts with Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's [_Control_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufJHc2EdBA).

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I‚Äôm so proud of that project, except for one part, It‚Äôs one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that‚Äôs the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart‚Äîyou know what I mean?‚Äîand, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ‚Äôcause I‚Äôm like, _bruh_, _I know I don‚Äôt really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

#### _April 12, 2024_:
_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.  
50 Cent tweets, [""WTF how I miss this, @JColeNC call my phone ‚òéÔ∏è right now!""](https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1777436348745396594)  

#### [_April 12, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/gZiywNz.png)
Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.  
> N\*\*\*as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?  
> I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son  
> Still don' trust you, it's always us, never them  
> Heard you dropped your latest shit  
> Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha)  

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.  
> You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped   
> Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down  
> Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now  
> ...  
> What the fuck is this, a 20-v-1, n\*\*\*a?  
> What's a prince to a king? He a son, n\*\*\*a  
> Get more love in the city that you from, n\*\*\*a  
> Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n\*\*\*a

#### [_April 13, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/UX5Ugqt.png)  
Rick Ross drops [_Champagne Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zLBDmB6Fc), a response aimed towards Drake. In the response, he repeatedly calls Drake ""white boy"", and claims that Drake sent a cease-and-desist to French Montana.  
> N\*\*\*as leakin‚Äô they records when we speakin' directly  
> If we keepin‚Äô it gangsta, when you see me you check me  
> White boy, I see you

> Yeah, you had that surgery, that six-pack gone  
> That's why you wearin' that funny shit at your show, you can't hide it, n\*\*\*a  
> White boy  

#### _April 14, 2024_:
Drake responds to Rick Ross in an expected fashion [via Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3vg1v/drake_fires_shots_at_rick_ross/), calling him a ""nosey goof"".  
> It's coming from Rick Ross the guy I did songs with he's gone loopy off the Mounjaro he hasn't eaten in days and it's turned him angry and racist he's performing at proms for money it's bad don't worry we'll handle it  
> @richforever you're one nosey goof

Rick Ross responds on [his own Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3wsbt/shots_fired_rick_ross_fires_back_at_drake_aka_bbl/), highlighting Drake's potential rhinoplasty and BBL surgeries.

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",False,False,hiphopheads,Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/

Apparently this beef started way before control and drake went on somebodies show and straight up dissed Kendrick. Then drakes team threatens that if the interview was aired he‚Äôs refuse to host the ESPYS.

Man this dude has been jealous for a WHILE

You can check out the list here: [Spotify's top 100 hip-hop songs](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-05-20/best-hip-hop-songs-100-top-tracks/). I'm curious to hear opinions on the list.

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.

I copied the list here for ease of viewing since sometimes the page wasn't loading for me.

But the track gets more intresting and deeper towards the end.

Kendrick says near the end:

‚ÄúYeah, OV-ho n***** is dick riders
Tell 'em run to America, they imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence‚Äù

He‚Äôs calling out Toronto gangs for being fake, imitators of American culture. More specifically he‚Äôs calling out Toronto gangs for imitating LA GANG culture. As he says ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt imitate this violence‚Äù

Then he starts mocking the Toronto accent and the slang. 

‚ÄúDon't speak on the family, crodie
It can get deep in the family, crodie
Talk about me and my family, crodie?
Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie‚Äù

He‚Äôs mocking them for the word ‚Äúcrodie‚Äù which is taken from the LA slang ‚Äúbrodie‚Äù, obviously changed from ‚Äúb‚Äù to ‚Äúc‚Äù because of the Crips in Toronto.

Kendrick is mocking Toronto gangs for being imitators of LA gangs and saying that they aren‚Äôt a threat.

This is when it gets deeper. He says:

 ‚ÄúI be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and blamy, crodie
Tell me you're cheesin', fam
We can do this right now on the camera, crodie‚Äù

New Ho King is a Chinese Resturant on Spadina Avenue in Toronto. New Ho King is ALSO where a Toronto rapper named Sizzlac filmed his last music video before being shot and killed.

Sizzlac got shot and killed days after dropping a diss record titled ‚ÄúRealest in the 6‚Äù, and in the music video for the record he‚Äôs at New Ho King.

Sizzlac is also rumored to be one of the people that robbed Drake at gunpoint in 2009. Drake got robbed in 2009 at a restaurant by two people at gunpoint and it‚Äôs been rumored for a long time that one of them was Sizzlac. Also supposedly Drake was going to file a police report, but didn‚Äôt because it would effect his rap career being labeled as a snitch. Remember Kendrick said ‚ÄúI know some shit about n***** that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint‚Äù. 

Drake got robbed and his chain was snatched after being set up by a girl. He raps about it in a few of his songs like ‚ÄúThe Reaistance‚Äù or ‚ÄúAway From Home‚Äù.

Drake recently has aligned himself with another Toronto rapper named Pressa. He brought him out on tour a few years ago and shouted him out on his latest album For All The Dogs. 

Pressa is apart of the Driftwood CRIPS gang. 

The Driftwood Crips and Sizzlacs gang have had a long rivalry.

Pressa said in his song Attachments, ‚ÄúSizzlac dead, and they don't post him on the 'Gram‚Äù

No one knows who shot and killed Sizzlac, it‚Äôs all rumors that it could have been someone from his gang or other gangs that killed him. 

So, when Kendrick says that he‚Äôs at New Ho King with a blammy and that he can do it on camera. He‚Äôs saying that unlike Sizzlac, he‚Äôs in Drakes city (Toronto) at New Ho King with a gun and that he‚Äôs ready to do it on camera. And also unlike Drake, he‚Äôs at a restaurant with a gun and won‚Äôt get robbed like he did. New Ho King is only like 5 minutes away from where Drake got robbed.

He also mocks the Toronto Crips (Driftwood Crips/Pressas Crew) by making fun of their slang, accent and calling them fake imitators of LA gang culture.

Kendrick saw that Drake has been aligning himself with these Crips in his city of Toronto (maybe even being involved in Sizzlacs death after getting robbed for his chain, remember Drake really started reffering to himself as the runner of the 6ix in 2016 after he died) and called Drakes BS. He called the Crips in his city fake, made fun of them for copying LA culture while also saying he‚Äôs at New Ho King with a gun and that Drake won‚Äôt do anything about it. 

This also ties in with him calling Drake a culture vulture throughout the track and is a direct response to Drake using LA legends AI voices like Pac and Snoop to diss Kendrick. ‚ÄúI'd rather do that than let a Canadian n**** make Pac turn in his grave‚Äù. Drake has been saying he‚Äôs bigger then Kendrick in LA, mocking him for supposedly being the ‚ÄúWest Coast Savior‚Äù so Kendrick returns fire by making fun of Toronto.



Also remember when Drake said:

‚ÄúHugs and kisses, man, don't tell me 'bout no switches
I'll be rockin' every fuckin' chain I own next visit, ayy‚Äù?

He says he‚Äôll rock every chain he owns on his next visit to LA. This could play into Kendrick with the subliminal Sizzlac reference, since he supposedly robbed Drakes chain in Toronto (his own city). 

Right at the end of the track Kendrick says: ‚ÄúThey punk y‚Äôall n*****, nobody never took my food‚Äù 

Reference to New Ho King and Drake (and Sizzlac) both getting punked in Toronto.

I didnt listen to either of these artist like at all. It‚Äôs not music you‚Äôll catch me bumping to. (though i do enjoy Kendrick‚Äòs disses very much, especially euphoria also the therapy session after family matters very relatable and understandable lol) So, when I came across all this information about drake signing artists and throwing them away when they no longer gave him benefit him. It kinda made me angry I ain‚Äôt even met the man before. I mean, these people have their own unique style and music. Drake? Not so much. It‚Äôs not wrong to want to be famous and loved. But when you have to suck the blood of others in order to reach this, is it really okay? At that point where is the morality. When I listened to the diss tracks, I noticed something too. Drake is either high on self esteem, entitled, or he is narcissistic. It‚Äôs not the fact that he views himself as the best. That‚Äôs not the problem. The problem is when you bring up things in someone‚Äôs life that are touchy subjects. The heart part 6. He didn‚Äôt need to bring up molestation in such a way when a lot of people struggle with that, and it‚Äôs not something someone has control over. That‚Äôs just something you don‚Äôt say. The way I saw it was a sign of narcissism. A lack of empathy in my opinion. And there are many more signs of narcissistic behavior from him too. The need to be validated was kinda obvious in his music. He was talking to a crowd at some point. Not to the person he was dissing. He wanted to sound good, and at some point I feel like the diss was no longer talking to Kendrick. It was like saying things in a roasting battle in front of your friends to look cool. If he was truly one with high self esteem he wouldn‚Äôt need to act cool in front of others. Someone with high self esteem doesn‚Äôt need validation. I‚Äôm no psychologist or psychiatrist. But this guy kinda sounds like a narcissistic person to me ngl.

Personally I don‚Äôt like this guy not because he isn‚Äôt real. But because he uses people and puts up an act to be accepted. I don‚Äôt like this guy cause he makes me people start to feel like they are in-debt to him. And when they don‚Äôt feel that way‚Ä¶well look at Kendrick. He starts to get sensitive about it. The amount of times he has tried to make Kendrick feel like he is in-debt to him is beyond me. It‚Äôs weird how no one has called this out like that. I get it, Drake helps these rappers. But the thing is, that doesn‚Äôt mean he owns their style or their career. They don‚Äôt have to live in the shadow of a guy that knows nothing of black culture. I‚Äôm happy Kendrick doesn‚Äôt feel in-debt and understood the assignment. Because people like drake want you to feel like you can‚Äôt reach that level, so you can continue to feed on the crumbs that you illusion yourself into believing is all you can have. All those rappers that feel they owe him, should know that he got what he wanted without them even having to actively pay your debt. That feeling is just an extra bonus for him. But this is just my thoughts, tell what you think in the comments lol

I've seen the fake mole copium and want to put that to bed.

When Push Ups leaked on April 13th, you can actually hear the beginning of Family Matters at the end of the track. This is a big piece of information because the argument is that the song had already been recorded mostly & Kendrick knew about it before it came out.

# Evidence

* Up until Family Matters release, Drake had not really said anything ***that bad*** about Kendrick's family (only the bodyguards like Whitney line) and Kendrick seems to agree on Euphoria (dropped April 30).
   * [We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way](https://genius.com/31596367/Kendrick-lamar-euphoria/We-aint-gotta-get-personal-this-a-friendly-fade-you-should-keep-it-that-way) [I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint](https://genius.com/31595848/Kendrick-lamar-euphoria/I-know-some-shit-about-niggas-that-make-gunna-wunna-look-like-a-saint)
* In Euphoria also, Kendrick threatens Drake multiple times to drop Family Matters, what Kendrick considers to be the straw that will break his back, in which Drake lies on him and his family. You can clearly tell in the song, Kendrick is daring him to drop it.
   * [Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too but don‚Äôt tell no lies bout me and I won‚Äôt tell no truths bout you](https://genius.com/31595737/Kendrick-lamar-euphoria/Know-you-a-master-manipulator-and-habitual-liar-too-but-dont-tell-no-lie-about-me-and-i-wont-tell-truths-bout-you)
      * clear threat to not lie in Family Matters about the domestic violence/infidelity of Whitney
   * [I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle](https://genius.com/31596356/Kendrick-lamar-euphoria/I-calculate-youre-not-as-calculated-i-can-even-predict-your-angle) [Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard¬†*Mr. Morale*, a pathetic master manipulator I can smell the tales on you now](https://genius.com/31595864/Kendrick-lamar-euphoria/Fabricatin-stories-on-the-family-front-cause-you-heard-mr-morale-a-pathetic-master-manipulator-i-can-smell-the-tales-on-you-now-youre-not-a-rap-artist-you-a-scam-artist-with-the-hopes-of-being-accepted)
      * Kendrick even lets Drake know here that he knows about the song and its contents
   * [If you take it there, I'm takin' it further‚Ä¶that‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt wanna do](https://genius.com/31596527/Kendrick-lamar-euphoria/If-you-take-it-there-im-takin-it-further-psst-thats-somethin-you-dont-wanna-do)
      * Ends with this eerie line, threatening him with the consequences of lying about Kendricks wife and kids.
   * Generally, euphoria is a lot less nuclear from Kendrick's end and is primarily filled with the threats that it ***can and will*** get much worse if Drake chooses to drop Family Matters.
* Then 6:16 drops (morning of May 3rd) with the infamous photo of the glove on the red shirt. Because we now know that Meet the Grahams has a zoomed out version of it as the cover art, we can draw some conclusions
   * 6:16 was released prior to Family Matters (FM dropped the night of May 3rd) as well, but the full photo SOMEHOW contained info about lyrics Drake would bring up in that song even though it had not been released yet. Here are the lines below:
      * [And, nigga, Cole losin' sleep on this, it ain't me](https://genius.com/31633364/Drake-family-matters/And-nigga-cole-losin-sleep-on-this-it-aint-me) : Drake is eventually revealed to have a Ambien sleeping meds prescription himself in the full zoomed out cover art
      * [What the fuck I heard Rick drop, nigga? Talkin' somethin' 'bout a nose job, nigga](https://genius.com/31634299/Drake-family-matters/What-the-fuck-i-heard-rick-drop-nigga-talkin-somethin-bout-a-nose-job-nigga) [Ozempic got a side effect of jealousy and doctor never told y'all niggas](https://genius.com/31633648/Drake-family-matters/Ozempic-got-a-side-effect-of-jealousy-and-doctor-never-told-yall-niggas) : Drake is eventually revealed to have a Ozempic prescription himself in the Meet The Grahams zoomed out cover art
   * On top of that, Kendrick says in 6:16 itself:
      * [Conspiracies about Cash, dog? That's not even the leak. Find the JEWELS like Kash Doll, I just need you to think](https://genius.com/31626341/Kendrick-lamar-6-16-in-la/Conspiracies-about-cash-dog-thats-not-even-the-leak-find-the-jewels-like-kash-doll-i-just-need-you-to-think).

      * He directly references the jewelry (engagement ring necklace) that Drake wears in the Family Matters video, once again, before the track has even dropped. And later we see the receipts for the jewelry in the full cover art when Meet The Grahams drops.
   * Ask yourself, how could Kendrick possibly have 1. Gotten the pictures in general 2. Known that it would relate to things in a song that is not yet released.
      * Answer: a legit mole is in Drake's camp and this gives you good reason to trust the other things Kendrick is saying about Aubrey in these diss tracks, as it is likely coming from inside Drake‚Äôs crew.
* Then we move the drop of Family Matters and the IMMEDIATE RESPONSE of Meet The Grahams, a song in which Kendrick goes right at Drake's family almost like he KNEW Drake would try to go for his
   * [Dear Aubrey I know you‚Äôre probably thinking I wanted to crash your party](https://genius.com/31634090/Kendrick-lamar-meet-the-grahams/Dear-aubrey-i-know-you-probably-thinkin-i-wanted-to-crash-your-party) [But truthfully, I don't have a hatin' bone in my body](https://genius.com/31634250/Kendrick-lamar-meet-the-grahams/But-truthfully-i-dont-have-a-hatin-bone-in-my-body-this-supposed-to-be-a-good-exhibition-within-the-game) [But you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name](https://genius.com/31634244/Kendrick-lamar-meet-the-grahams/But-you-fucked-up-the-moment-you-called-out-my-familys-name) [Why you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?](https://genius.com/31634277/Kendrick-lamar-meet-the-grahams/Why-you-had-to-stoop-so-low-to-discredit-some-decent-people-guess-integrity-is-lost-when-the-metaphors-doesnt-reach-you)
      * Furthering again the theory (fact?) that Kendrick knew about Family Matters beforehand. He had these lyrics pre-written and ready to be fired off once Drake dropped
      * These lines are similar to the threats he made on euphoria but now Family Matters is out and the funeral has begun with Meet the Grahams

This might be low hanging fruit for y'all but I'm so sick of seeing this fake mole theory from Drake stans, makes zero sense. Kendrick is getting legit info from someone within Drake's camp and the proof is in the lyrics of these disses and the cover arts as well. Wild stuff.

That's pretty much it. I'll leave you with this:

Kendrick has been lying his whole career and I don‚Äôt know how you can support him. 

Early on, he claimed to be a good kid in a mad city. Curious. 

If he was really such a good kid, what was he doing out late with his mom‚Äôs van, which he didn‚Äôt bring back on time? Smh. 

But ok, maybe we don‚Äôt really know what kind of kid he was. But if it truly was a mad city, then how come his own idol, Tupac, admitted that they ‚Äúknow how to party‚Äù? In fact, I heard they ‚Äúkeep it rocking in the city of Compton‚Äù 

Further, if it was such a mad city, then how is it possible that Ice Cube, a legend, actually ‚Äúhad a good day‚Äù?

Ok, maybe Kendrick was just young back then and didn‚Äôt know any better when GKMC was released. 

But even on his very last track, he clearly states ‚Äú(‚Ä¶) I‚Äôm John Stockton‚Äù. But he is, in fact, not John Stockton, because he is Kendrick Lamar. Which is it?!

It just doesn‚Äôt add up. I rest my case. 

EDIT:

We have now received a statement from the Board of Education that they have no record of Kendrick becoming certified as a boogeyman.

4. Drake says whoever feeding Kendrick lines is a clown, and then says that he planted the info.
5. Drake tries to make a connection with ""Mother I"" about Kendrick being molested, when the whole song is about him not being molested.
6. Drake says he doesn't want to keep battling a woman beater because it feeds his nature... calling himself a woman.

Whether bad writing, self-snitching, or something else, this track is full of lines that are just plain... confusing, especially if you buy into Drake's narrative at all. The only conclusion I can draw is that it's panic induced sloppiness.

**EDIT**: Apparently this post is getting [ripped and put on comment sections ](https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/s/hvPh9E4X3R). I'm so proud of my dumbass copypasta baby. Say cheese folks

**EDIT 2**: Alright I'm getting the same comments like 50 times under this post, so here's an explainer: my point isn't that these lines are incomprehensible, it's that they're all *choices* that are near misses to a much better choice. With level head there's clearly a better way to go about each of these, making this string of choices reek of rushed writing.

1. The Gunna Wunna bar could mean multiple things: that Kendrick has a lot of dirt, that if Kendrick speaks on the dirt he'll expose more than Gunna did and send people to jail, or even that someone else in Drake's circle is a rat. To take this one obtuse line and dedicate 5 bars to it when there's so much more shit to address is a weird self-snitch. Like someone saying ""I know what you did"" and you respond ""I didn't eat all the cookies"".
2. You do not want your name associated with Epstein. It's bad optics. The only name Drake needed to respond to was Weinstein- it even fits the same rhyme scheme. Or just don't mention these names, and address the accusations as they are. It's an unnecessary addition that makes the optics worse.
3. Same as above. That you bring this up reminds listeners of MBB, where Kendrick never mentioned her. You already addressed her in For All The Dogs- volunteering a public case of your weirdo antics while defending yourself is bad optics, that he didn't need to engage in unless Kendrick had brought it up.
4. I'm not saying he's literally calling himself a clown: he's trying to push two contradictory narratives. Are Kendrick's sources clowns who make shit up, or are they your mastermind spies? He can't seem to decide his angle.
5. He clearly didn't listen to Mother I Sober. Also making fun of victims is no bueno.
6. Yall think I'm saying Drake is outing himself as a trans woman? The bar is worded in a way where it implies Drake is a woman, since battling him enables a woman beater. It's sloppy writing- he could've written the bar differently so as not to have that funny accidental meaning.

Yes, we all know they‚Äôve been sending subliminals to each other for over a decade and have been beefing for a while now, but since ""DAMN.,"" no one has really paid attention to the subliminals in their music, and they‚Äôve been directly responding to each other in songs for a while now.

Here‚Äôs some backstory on where I think this modern beef started. On March 5, 2021, Drake released the song ""What‚Äôs Next."" The song was originally supposed to have Baby Keem on it, but his verse was left off, and it was just Drake on the song. I‚Äôm just going to leave this information here because it might play into the later disses.

**Family Ties**

[August 27, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/aih3bgw9bp1d1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b4c3dfeb080a040e938ada0cda50205d5c130ba)

Where I think the disses really start is on ""Family Ties"" with Kendrick Lamar. This song is the first official collaboration between Keem and Kendrick. It comes five months after What‚Äôs Next. In Kendrick‚Äôs verse, he states that he‚Äôs:

""Smokin' on your top five tonight, tonight

Yeah, I'm smokin' on your, what's his name, tonight, tonight.""

This could be aimed at anybody in the game, but I think it‚Äôs directly targeted towards Drake based on the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs his name,‚Äù since Drake and Rihanna have a song called ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs My Name.‚Äù Kendrick is saying he‚Äôs smoking on Drake.

Throughout Kendrick‚Äôs verse, he starts calling himself the GOAT and explains why he‚Äôs been absent in the game before this. At the end of the track, Baby Keem says:

""Number two DM'ing my bitch

That's cool, I don't ask why.""

""Number two"" here refers to Drake, as number one would be Kendrick Lamar. Drake is known for DMing people‚Äôs girls and stuff like that; Baby Keem says Drake is DMing his girl and is confused.

https://preview.redd.it/f8c3x1uhbp1d1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=042914e480929880962297dff8e7f1c585752c02

It‚Äôs been about a year since ""Family Ties,"" and Kendrick releases his next studio album in five years. The album is supposed to address his demons and is about his growth and maturity through therapy. I think there are some subliminal on here towards Drake.

**Father Time**

This entire track is Kendrick addressing the issue of parenthood, specifically fatherhood, and the toxic nature of present and absent fathers due to the toxic masculinity that is passed through generations. It‚Äôs interesting that this is the track where Kendrick directly mentions Drake's name since we know later on Kendrick would call Drake a bad/absent father and call his father absent as well.

""When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused

Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do.""

Kanye and Drake got back together for the Larry Hoover concert, and here Kendrick is confused about why Kanye ‚Äúmade up‚Äù with Drake. He realized he‚Äôs not as mature as he thinks and has some healing to do because he wouldn‚Äôt get back with Drake like Kanye did.

**Rich Spirit**

I think ""Rich Spirit"" might be the real warning shot towards Drake. I also think this is a direct reply to ""Toosie Slide."" The entire ""Rich Spirit"" video is him alone in his house, away from fame and society. There are a lot of lines here that, in retrospect, seem to be Kendrick telling Drake what a real ‚ÄúRich Spirit‚Äù is. For example:

""Takin' my baby to school, then I pray for her.""

This is something Kendrick directly attacks Drake for in his diss tracks.

""And celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool.""

Kendrick is saying that celebrity does not equal integrity. He also uses this same angle in his diss tracks later on.

""Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (Yeah)

Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (Ooh).""

This is pretty obvious. Kendrick is telling Drake to stop playing with him before he turns him into a song (diss track) like he did with ""Not Like Us.""

¬†Here‚Äôs where I think it gets even more obvious:

""Ayy, clout chasing hell of a disease, brother

I'm fasting four days out the week, brother

I pray to God that you realize the entourage is dead

I pray to God that you not lackin' when you off the meds

I pray to God she knows them Cabo trips don't last forever

Bet she argues with her momma, go and get them kids.""

Everything Kendrick says here is exactly what he says to Drake in his diss tracks. He mentions meds, his entourage is against him, calls him out for his trips to islands, and calls him a clout chaser. This is clearly referencing Drake.¬†

These lines directly reference J Prince, like he does in ""Euphoria"":

""I pray to God you actually pray when somebody dies

Thoughts and prayers, way better off timelines

False claimin' not cute, I'm mortified

The new Earth in hot pursuit, two-hundred lives.""

He says the exact same thing to J Prince in ""Euphoria.""

He also says: 

‚ÄúI would never live my life on the computer
IG'll get you life for a chikabooya
More power to ya, love 'em from a distance
Why you always in the mirror more than the bitches?‚Äù

Drake is known for his antics online and Instagram captions/Internet culture. This one‚Äôs also pretty obvious. 

**Honestly, Nevermind**

https://preview.redd.it/hhptm12nbp1d1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=87ccec540b1538faa76f59c155994690808250cc

Drake responds to Kendrick on his album ""Honestly, Nevermind."" What‚Äôs important to realize here is that this album dropped on Kendrick‚Äôs birthday. The entire album is club-inspired music and was something people did not expect, and he dropped it on Kendrick‚Äôs birthday on purpose. It was to showcase to Kendrick that he can make music that Kendrick couldn‚Äôt. The entire album is club-inspired music except for the last track ‚ÄúSticky‚Äù with 21 Savage. On this track, Drake states:

""Couple hits, now you brave, boy

You n\*\*\*\* better behave (What)

All that pumpin' up your chest (What)

All that talk about the best (What)

You know how sticky it gets.""

He‚Äôs telling Kendrick to behave and stop talking about how he‚Äôs the best like he did on ""Family Ties."" Now what‚Äôs very interesting is that Kendrick & Baby Keem directly respond to this track on ""The Hillbillies."" I don‚Äôt think people realize that ""The Hillbillies"" is a direct response to this. But before The Hillbillies was the ""America Has a Problem"" remix with Beyonc√©. This entire verse is clearly a Drake diss.

**America Has a Problem Remix**

https://preview.redd.it/41ncfnysbp1d1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f1ba1948e5a70de84ac6b88fea298655a8ab95f

""Geeked up, choosy love, well, they chose violence

Universal, please don't play possum

I'm a businessman doin' as follows

Truthfully, I be lyin' in my rap song

'Cause I always fail to mention I'd slap homie

His career didn't come with no life insurance

Hope his day-one fans got some facts on him.""

He calls out Universal (UMG), saying he‚Äôs just a businessman doing as he chooses. He states that he‚Äôs lying in songs because he fails to mention he‚Äôll slap somebody. He states that this person's career didn‚Äôt come with life insurance and hopes his day-one fans have some facts on him. He‚Äôs clearly referring to Drake here.

""Them diamonds don't be fly, they all CGI

You better get it off your chest like breast reduction

If she stressed over you, she stressed for nothin'.""

In these lines, he calls Drake's diamonds fake and states that Drake should get it off his chest like breast reduction. He‚Äôs mocking his surgery yet again. Then the ‚Äúif she stressed over you, she stressed for nothing‚Äù is a subliminal towards Drake‚Äôs latest album before this track, ""Her Loss,"" stating that it‚Äôs not her loss since if she‚Äôs stressed over Drake, she isn‚Äôt stressed for anything.

Next, he says:

""Even AI gotta practice clonin' Kendrick

The double entendre, the encore remnants

I bop like ten men, the opps need ten men.""

During the time when this track came out, there was AI Drake music blowing up. Kendrick is saying that even AI needs to practice to clone him, using a double entendre to imply he‚Äôs unmatched. He is saying the opps ‚Äúneed ten men‚Äù aka the ghostwriters, he is calling Drake easily replaceable. Now onto The Hillbillies.¬†

**The Hillbillies**

https://preview.redd.it/5ugsqc2wbp1d1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=fac50b242aec856fea19f304ff08264c94d460c9

""The Hillbillies"" was released on May 30, 2023. The entire track is completely different from the music that Kendrick normally makes. It‚Äôs a track where he‚Äôs flexing, and it‚Äôs over a club-inspired beat and flow. Baby Keem even called it a ‚ÄúSticky‚Äù remix. So this track is basically Kendrick saying that he can do what Drake did on ""Honestly, Nevermind,"" but better. 

First, let‚Äôs look at the title of the track. It is called ‚ÄúThe Hillbillies.‚Äù¬†

On ""Sticky,"" Drake says that he‚Äôs:

""King of the hill, you know it's a steep one.""

Drake calls himself the king of the hill, Kendrick & Keem call themselves the Hillbillies, you get it.

Now let‚Äôs look at some lines in the track:

""Messi, get them girls off the stage, 'cause somebody's gonna get taken

Somebody's gonna invade on a one-on-one conversation

I'm ducked off from the world, I'm immersed in the PlayStation.""

This is a direct response to ""Sticky"" when Drake says:

""Ayo Eric, bring them girls to the stage

'Cause somebody's getting paid.""

Throughout this entire track, Kendrick and Keem are mocking Drake and his flow on ""Sticky,"" showcasing they can do anything he can do and better. They‚Äôre rapping about the things he‚Äôll rap about. Also what I find interesting about the music video is that they have Tyler in it and announce that they will be headlining Camp Flog Gnaw in the video, where Drake famously got booed off stage. Could be a reach but still.

In July a month after this track, Drake on stage during his tour said ‚Äúhe is not like those rappers who disappear for 4 or 5 years‚Äù. So another subliminal towards Kendrick.

**Meltdown**

https://preview.redd.it/spcuz8zybp1d1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d636950b1706368297a514c110e1a4351f06ded

Drake responds to the disses on ""Meltdown,"" which was released two months later on Travis Scott‚Äôs album. While this verse is mainly about Kanye/Pusha, I also think it can relate to Kendrick as well.

""I love to fuck on a regular bitch

Famous hoes lame, but they stay on my dick

Heard your new joint, it's embarrassing, shit.""

On ""Hillbillies,"" Kendrick/Keem rap about wanting a regular girl instead of a famous girl, and on ""Meltdown,"" Drake says the same thing, also calling their new stuff embarrassing.

""Your bodyguard put in some work on a fluke

Now you wanna go and inherit that shit

Don't talk to

the boy 'bout comparisons, shit

Or come to the boy on some arrogant shit.""

More bodyguards talk, and he‚Äôs telling people not to compare him to anybody. We all know who he really means.

‚ÄúI melt down the chains that I bought from yo' boss

Give a fuck about all of that heritage shit.‚Äù

Kendrick directly responds to this, saying he inherited the beef from Pharrell since Drake was disrespecting him. Now here‚Äôs where I think it gets obvious. On the second verse, Travis says:

""The boy going Lionel Messi, I go Tom Brady (Woo).""

In the track ""The Hillbillies,"" Keem is calling Kendrick Messi and himself Neymar. Now in this track, which comes out two months later, Drake is comparing himself to Messi.

Also he says in this song ""You act like you love this American shit, but really the truth is you scared of the 6"" which could be a response to the title ""America Has a Problem"", this might be a reach though.

**First Person Shooter**

https://preview.redd.it/emn9lgd2cp1d1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc52eeee5b1834f392c657c306dff32dab17746a

After ""Meltdown,"" we get ""First Person Shooter,"" which we all know ignited this beef even further. I have a theory about this track, though. I believe that Drake originally sent Kendrick the track to hop on, but Kendrick denied the feature request. I think the original ""First Person Shooter"" was going to feature Drake, Cole, and Kendrick rapping over the first beat of the song. I believe the beat switch was made after Kendrick denied the feature request, and Drake added it later. This is why Kendrick says on his diss tracks:

""Surprised you sent that feature request, you know we got some shit to address"" and ""Did Cole foul, I don‚Äôt know why you still pretending.""

Drake wanted to squash the subliminal beef he had with Kendrick with the feature request, and when Kendrick denied it, he thought it was real beef.

Look at the second half of ""FPS"":

""My youngins richer than you rappers and they all stream

I really hate that you been sellin' them some false dreams

Man, if your pub was up for sale, I buy the whole thing

Will they ever give me flowers? Well, of course not

They don't wanna have that talk, 'cause it's a sore spot

They know The Boy, the one they gotta boycott

I told Jimmy Jam I use a GRAMMY as a door stop.""

Drake gets way more aggressive in the second half of the track and states that Kendrick is selling people false dreams, he is broke, they won't give him his flowers, he is at the top, and that he doesn't care about GRAMMYs (which is what Drake mocks Kendrick for in ""Family Matters"").¬†

Then he says:

""What the fuck, bro? I'm one away from Michael

N\*\*\*, beat it, n\*\*\*\*, beat it, what?""

He compares himself to Michael Jackson and even says he will beat his record, which Kendrick directly responds to in ""Like That."" At the end of the track, Drake says: ""Don't even pay me back on none of them favors, I don't need it.""

We know that Drake feels like he put on Kendrick and that Kendrick would be nowhere without him, so he rubs that in his face. This verse is where I think Kendrick really took it as a threat rather than just the big three line. That was a part of it, but I think this is what really set Kendrick off. Also interestingly in this video Drake recreates the Messi/Ronaldo picture with J. Cole and compares himself to Messi AGAIN.

Another thing, in the second verse Drake says:

‚ÄúI click the trigger on the stick like a high beam‚Äù

So in Like That when Kendrick says ‚Äúif he walk around with that stick, it ain‚Äôt Andre 3k‚Äù it could be reffering to this line as well since that track is a direct response to this song. At first most people thought the stick line was about Cole but we know Kendrick calls out Drake for acting tough later on, so it could be a response to this line as well.

**Red Button**

https://preview.redd.it/y8zhrmr5cp1d1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d40f3c901c2afecd20743066c736c3f29e2a6ba

A month after this track, Drake releases ‚ÄúRed Button‚Äù on ""Scary Hours 3,"" and I also think this is about Kendrick Lamar (and Kanye, but we are focusing on Dot here).

This entire track, Drake is warning people that if he presses his red button, it will be over for certain people. This red button thing obviously refers to Kendrick since during their diss tracks, Drake was constantly talking about pushing the red button and posting images of red buttons.

‚ÄúN\*\*\*\* think it's sweet, but I am not a diabetic patient

No, I will start blackin' over here like it's segregation

I will fuckin' double-cross you n\*\*\*\* like it's meditation

I'll give you a hard pill to swallow, this your medication

I will fuckin' pop up on your ass like a revelation

I could tell you better than I show you, this a demonstration

I will fuckin' leave you in the dirt like some vegetation

Chemicals is mixin' in my brain and killin' hesitation

I will fuckin' force a few shots like a vaccination

I'll get to you ten years from now like procrastination

I'll fuckin' find out wherever y'all are celebratin'

Pull up, park my Phantom on the curb like I'm Larry David

And then we'll see who's really crazy‚Äù

I have a feeling this is about Kendrick specifically based on the words he‚Äôs choosing to talk about, like segregation and procrastination. Things that he makes fun of Kendrick for in his latest disses.

After this we know what happens, Kendrick responds on Like That and the beef really ignites with the diss tracks coming out.",False,False,KendrickLamar,The Secret Subliminal War Between Kendrick Lamar and Drake,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/1cwyuot/the_secret_subliminal_war_between_kendrick_lamar/

Pusha T exposed his child. 

No telling what Kendrick knows.

But here‚Äôs a trail of breadcrumbs I‚Äôve been following in terms of what it might be:

// Golden Goose Theory ü™ø //

Joe Budden is the biggest analyst of Drake‚Äôs career‚Äîfor better or worse. Recently, I peeped how Joe‚Äôs been mentioning in recent pods that ‚Äòit‚Äôs not normal for someone like Drake to be doing tours back to back domestically, or even dropping albums at the rate he does.‚Äô Or even how he‚Äôs being paid (or possibly even forced) to promote artists like Sexxy Red.

In other words, Drake isn‚Äôt in control.

Everyone talks about Drake‚Äôs run being impressive, but no one talks about his run being programmed‚Äîyou don‚Äôt go that far for that long without the machines working for you and in your favor üëÄThere are too many big names making money from the ‚Äògolden goose‚Äô and too many eating off of this man ... he may not have the ‚Äòpull‚Äô we think he does. In fact, it‚Äôs likely all an illusion. He can‚Äôt stop if he wanted to.

I think this is one of the more hard-hitting truths Kendrick might expose, especially since he already hinted at the fakeness of the Drake-Cole link up and the fact that Prince, known for authenticity in his artistry, outlived Michael Jackson, who was also on the pop star treadmill.

// Protecting the Investment üí∞ //

There‚Äôs also the rumor that Drake‚Äôs recent deal is worth $500M. But no one 'gives you' 500Ms without wanting 2-3x back, it's an investment and they don‚Äôt want to lose money on it.Can they make their money back if Drake‚Äôs stock is lowered by the ONLY other elite rapper who could lower it and lessen Drake‚Äôs appeal to the masses?

Rap is the WWE, all smoke and mirrors, and the business teams are the making calls behind the scenes.

// Business Approvals for Rap Beef ü•© //

To that point, Drake can‚Äôt respond to Kendrick on his own lol. Drake is a business, and he needs approval, which he might not be getting at the moment because it's Kendrick he's going up against.

He told on himself after Pusha released Story of Adidon. J Prince wouldn't let him release his response because it would have 'damaged his brand' aka messed with the money.

So I'm pretty sure there's a business reason behind either a delayed response to Kendrick or no response at all ‚Äì regardless, seems like it‚Äôs not even Drake‚Äôs call to make.

// The Crumbling of an Empire üç™üõçÔ∏è //

Mos Def already alluded to Drake‚Äôs empire crumbling soon. Is it a coincidence that we see so many rappers switching up with this Kendrick verse?

Future 
Metro 
Rick Ross

And that‚Äôs just publicly.

To wrap this up, Kendrick is already winning. His feature verse was a response to FPS, so it doesn‚Äôt make sense for him to keep shooting right now.

But if the rumors are true, he already has the clip loaded and ready. And I don‚Äôt think Drake wants to see what‚Äôs on the other side.

If all of the leaks were a setup, then Drake would know that Kendrick had been given Family Matters ahead of time and that Kendrick would have a response track waiting (Meet the Grahams), so Drake would then have a track ready to go revealing the trap. It would have gone, Drake drops Family Matters, Kendrick drops Meet the Grahams, then Drake drops a track right after revealing that he set Kendrick up. Part of the reason that MtG is so lethal is that Kendrick dropped it immediately after Family Matters (proving that he knew Family Matters was coming). It wouldn't have been nearly as powerful if he released it a day or two from now, so why would Drake setup a trap and then not utilize it?

If only some of the leaks were a setup (e.g. just the daughter rumor and the MtG cover), then that would mean that there is a real mole and they're the one who leaked Family Matters to Kendrick. So if that's true, then that mole would also have known about the setup and then so would Kendrick.

Drake setting this up is paradoxical because the way it played out, has it looking clearly to outsiders like he got outplayed by Kendrick. It's infinitely more likely that Drake got caught off guard and is doing the only thing he can, deflecting and trying to muddy the waters by latching onto attempts to spin the narrative by random internet posters. That way Drake doesn't have to actually commit to a specific narrative and if those random posts get debunked, he doesn't take a hit since he never actually said that's what happened, but he's more than happy to have it out there making the truth cloudy.

**EDIT/further discussion about how the narrative can be twisted. I've seen people mention the contents of the MtG cover as ""proof"" that Drake set Kendrick up, this is part of twisting the narrative. People saying that it would be too obvious for all of that to have been in a suitcase, I agree, I don't think it was.** 

I have another explanation for the 6:16 and MtG covers, I believe that the 6:16 in LA cover was Kendrick challenging Drake to a ""duel"". There used to be a practice that if someone took off their glove and slapped another person in the face with it, they were being challenged to a duel. It was then a matter of pride that the other person had to agree to the duel. However, once at the duel it was considered respectable for both people to purposefully shoot wide, that way both people could walk away alive and with their pride intact. On the other hand, if someone comes in with the intent to kill, that's how you end up with a duel to the death. The death of Hamilton is an example of this, Burr claimed that Hamilton was clearly intending to actually shoot at him while some witnesses claimed that Hamilton was intending to shoot wide, but Burr shot and killed him. So the cover of ""6:16 in LA"" is Kendrick challenging Drake to a duel, to which Drake responded with ""Family Matters"" which is clearly intent to kill, then Kendrick dropped ""Meet the Grahams"" in response showing the same lethal intent.

The cover of ""Meet the Grahams"", the only person I've seen say that it all came from Drake's dad's suitcase is AK and that he got that information from someone in Kendrick's circle. Is that even true that he was told that and if it is, was what he was told true? Let's just say it isn't because I too want to play the narrative spinning game of what the cover could have meant.

Without AK, Kendrick hasn't said anything specific about the cover, so it's entirely possible that the items are there for different reasons and have different origins, some maybe not coming from Drake.

1. The shirt has a dog pissing on a fire hydrant, just like how Drake got his leg pissed on by T.I.'s friend. Then ""Shortee Collection"", Drake is calling Kendrick short and Kendrick is saying that this is part of his collection of Drake's stuff/information on Drake. It's entirely possible that this is something Kendrick bought specifically for the different meanings.
2. The prescriptions were stolen from Drake, proof that he has moles and that people surrounding him are willing to steal from him
3. The glove ties in with the duel challenge, notice how it appears to be a single glove with the tag still on it, nobody sells single gloves, so the other one would have been removed for a reason. Plus as other people have pointed out, Maybach tying in with Ross, so possibly some sort of play on Ross challenging Drake to a duel, where they both shot wide and now Kendrick and Drake were going to have theirs. Putting the choice to Drake on if he wanted to try and take that lethal shot or shoot wide. Then you of course have potentially allusions to the MJ/Drake discussions, as they both have worn the single glove. Same as the shirt, it's entirely possible that Kendrick bought the glove for these specific meanings.
4. I've seen a number of theories about the jewelry stuff, including that one of the receipts is for the ring from ""Family Matters"" that is supposed to be Whitney's, and it's entirely possible that Nadine Ghosn, the name on the business card, made Drake that replica. Further proof that Drake has a mole and that Kendrick is a step ahead of Drake.

I'm not saying that all or any of these are true, but I've seen a bunch of people running with AK's claims and then saying that the suitcase was a setup as well by making the same type of random attachments, so I wanted to show how you can spin a narrative and just because you can make a puzzle piece fit, doesn't mean that's where it goes.",False,False,KendrickLamar,"Put the ""Drake setup Kendrick"" narrative to bed, it's a paradox",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/1ck58nx/put_the_drake_setup_kendrick_narrative_to_bed_its/

Hip-hop/rap being on the decline has been a frequent topic of discussion for the past few years.

Could the defeat of commercial rap's figurehead finally signify an end to hip-hop's reign over the mainstream?

Will the triumph of the conscious-adjacent poet laureate artist signify a resurgence of more conscious underground hip-hop?

The death of XXXtentacion marked the end of the Soundcloud Rap era. Imo Drake's defeat feels like a continuation of that. Trending away from the shallow and blatant hedonism and violence that has dominated much of the mainstream‚Äînot for any puritanical reason, but simply due to over-saturation and fatigue.

If hip-hop as a genre begins to trend towards its more conscious and artistic roots, it will also naturally fall from the mainstream.

Of course, a part of me sees this as wholly unrealistic. On the other hand, artists like Earl Sweatshirt, MIKE, and Armand Hammer are making some great shit and picking up significant traction.

And I feel like there's only so many songs I can listen to about fucking your bitch in the throat, killing people, and buying expensive shit before getting bored and craving a little more substance. Also, it seems like people are becoming less misogynistic on the whole, and some of the things commonly said in rap just seem to come off grosser as time goes on. Maybe there's something in the air, people might be over that. Just something I'm picking up on

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to sound like an oldhead boomer complaining about mUsIc ThEsE dAyS; there will always be a space and demand for hedonistic bangers. But on the whole, I can't really imagine that these current trends stay exactly the same for another decade or two. At some point, what's popular is going to change. What marks that, and what will it shift to?

Surprisingly, there seems to be a major surge in the popularity of country music. In a way, this was prophesied by the popularity of Corridos Tumbados‚Äîartists like Peso Pluma somehow making acoustic music popular among the youth.

It makes sense‚Äîwe're still in post-pandemic recovery mode in an increasingly isolated world. We yearn for a sense of togetherness and unity. We want tangible, real world connections, and country music's sing-along tracks with real physical instruments taps directly into that need. But ngl, I'm not really rocking w country music. So I hope hip-hop figures out its own answer to that.

Tracks like Kanye's *Carnival*, with its stadium-anthem chorus feeds into that need for togetherness (s/o [Professor Skye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrbotKxx2nk) for that). The same phenomenon can be observed in places like Japan, where Yuki Chiba's *[Team Tomodachi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1UaGJlsw5g)* is going mega viral (the title means ""team friends,"" it's a banger about hanging out w your buddies lol). Most recently, Kendrick Lamar's ""Not Like Us"" seems to unify not only the West Coast, but hip-hop fans in general.

All this is to say that there do seem to be certain emerging trends, in conjunction with certain needs people are yearning to fulfill. The latest rap beef between Kendrick and Drake certainly fed into this desire for togetherness, but it also feels like some kind of major shift.

This prompted thousands of his followers to comment Palestine flags on said post. OVO 40, a pro-Palestinian producer that works with Drake, joined the onslaught as well.

There are two issues with this. First, Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs official Instagram account is not managed by Kendrick Lamar himself. He does not check it at all, and his only activity since 2022 was a link to euphoria on Tuesday on his story. Kendrick is more active on jojoruski, but even then, he regularly disappears for months at a time for mental health breaks. His company pgLang has made advertisements for Light Phone, further emphasizing his distaste for social media and the mental energy that social media consumes. He prefers, as he alluded to in his latest song, to spend quality time with his kids and raise his family. This also explains Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs alleged ‚Äúsilence‚Äù on the recent escalation of the Gaza genocide ‚Äî it‚Äôs not that Kendrick isn‚Äôt doing anything, but just that he prefers to keep his philanthropic efforts separate from his public persona and only come into the limelight when he has music. Remember, he did the exact same thing when George Floyd was murdered.

Secondly, Beydoun‚Äôs comments were most likely removed not by Kendrick Lamar or his team, but rather by Meta themselves. There have been numerous examples of pro-Palestinian comments being removed from an Instagram post, even in cases when the author of the Instagram post wishes for them to stay. Here are a few investigations/studies into the phenomenon:

[https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/12/21/metas-broken-promises/systemic-censorship-palestine-content-instagram-and](https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/12/21/metas-broken-promises/systemic-censorship-palestine-content-instagram-and)

More can be found easily.

Meta has a huge alliance with Israel and is currently waging a huge censorship campaign against pro-Palestinians. It is not surprising in the slightest that their algorithm picked up what they perceived to be ‚Äúspam‚Äù on an otherwise unrelated post, and removed it as part of this censorship campaign. It does not help whatsoever that the comment that was removed was Khaled Beydoun‚Äôs first comment on any IG:KendrickLamar post, and Khaled Beydoun is a well-known Palestinian activist who has been taken down on Instagram time and time again; in fact, he was probably targeted specifically and taken down immediately upon his first comment on the account. It‚Äôs a shame that Beydoun directed his frustration at Lamar directly, rather than the actual issue, Meta‚Äôs mass systemic censorship routine.

But thirdly and most importantly, Kendrick Lamar is not a Zionist. And this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúspeculation,‚Äù or ‚Äúwishful thinking‚Äù or ‚Äúcope‚Äù (I know Drake stans frequent this subreddit). It‚Äôs just common sense. Is there any reason to believe he is? Kendrick Lamar isn‚Äôt Jewish, so it‚Äôs not as though the Zionist idea is encouraged within his community (props to Drake for exiting that mindset). Kendrick Lamar, on the contrary, has expressed time and time again that he stands for social justice, against systemic racism, against apartheid (TPAB anyone?), against discrimination of any kind, even on the basis of gender identity. These issues are directly adjacent and connected to the Palestinian plight, and virtually everyone who stands with one of those issues will stand with the Palestinians. Even¬†*without*¬†all that, do you really believe that Kendrick Lamar, witnessing the mass destruction and murder of Palestinian children; children who committed no crime and yet have to face life every day not knowing if their own family members will live by the end of it ‚Äî a nonstop hell ‚Äî do you really believe that Kendrick Lamar of all people would look at that and say ‚Äúdeserved.‚Äù?

>What if he‚Äôs a sellout?

Sellout to who? He OWNS his own company.

>What about the lines on YAH. and other DAMN. songs?

Kendrick Lamar isn‚Äôt a Black Israelite; those lines were from the perspective of a man influenced by Kendrick‚Äôs cousin (or his cousin himself), who is a Black Israelite, but even if he was, Black Israelite ideology has nothing to do whatsoever with Zionism; in fact, the two ideologies often clash. If they are Zionists, they are Zionists in the Lauryn Hill sense, where Zion represents equality and justice for Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, and not Zionism in the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs raid Palestine and establish a Jewish state‚Äù sense. This confusion comes from looking at the lines at face value and not considering that he‚Äôs saying anything other than what he appears to be. By that logic, every single one of Tyler Joseph‚Äôs friends are ‚Äúheathens, take it slow.‚Äù

And now, to finally begin speculating, it seems as though the master manipulator Drake is using this conflict to drive a wedge between Kendrick Lamar and his fans, using Drake‚Äôs (only mild, to be genuinely fair) public support for Palestine as a point of moral superiority.

So, to conclude, don‚Äôt fall for the tricks. Kendrick Lamar stands with Palestine.

UMG would rather lose Kendrick than Drake, especially considering Kendrick rarely puts out music anymore. Drake is worth a lot more dollars than Kendrick.

Nobody knows how it will be remembered in rap history (it's only been a few weeks since it ended), but each day that passes, Kendrick Lamar looks better and better.

Drake is 37 and Kendrick is 36, but Kendrick absolutely sonned Drake. The maturity gap is insane.

Like a bored teenager, Drake made ""Pushups"" just to stir up shit. Like a little kid throwing stones at windows just to get a reaction... Kendrick on the other hand, was not reaction-seeking at all. He played it perfectly. Dropped songs on his schedule, and set his own tone. Didn't ""troll like a bitch,"" just dropped songs.

And boy, did he set the tone. They were playing different games. Drake was joking about Size 7 shoes, Kendrick Lamar was lecturing Drake's son and saying Drake should die for the betterment of humanity. Drake was really really trying to keep it üé∂PGüé∂ while Kendrick was trying to mutilate his soul.

People try to make it a wash by saying ""Neither came with receipts, so it's hard to know who really won."" But if altering public perception was the name of the game, Kendrick won that too. His accusations actually sound credible. They're not random. It wasn't like Kendrick said ""Drake, you kill puppies and steal money from charities."" Kendrick said stuff that people were already suspicious about. True or not, when accusations sound plausible, people are much more likely to believe.

Drake is going to be remembered as a very unserious person. He thought he'd just start a rap battle against a bunch of people for the lulz and thought poking the bear had no consequences. Drake focused on sounding catchy and ultimately dumbed down his music (overexplained his lines, which were all surface level anyway). He tried to strut and talk about numbers (""You ain't creepin up""), which is all dandy if you're rapping for fun, but the audience doesn't want to hear you brag on a diss track. Kendrick kept it deep, cryptic (knowing people would be studying every word with a microscope). He RESPECTED the art. He RESPECTED the audience. He RESPECTED the culture.

He didn't have to take shortcuts like Drake did. Drake's diss songs have no depth other than ""trying to troll and strike a chord to get into a fun rap battle."" Kendrick's lines are dense and littered with references. So deep people are still digging.

Drake is 37 showing up as a 7 year old... Kendrick is 36 showing up as a 60 year old.

[An X / Twitter](https://twitter.com/EbonyPrince2k24)  created May '24 posted a video that shows off the items from the ' [meet the grahams](https://youtu.be/2QiFl9Dc7D0)' cover art.

The white Popular Jewelry receipt is physically blocked by a Nadine Ghosn card on the cover art. In a video posted by Ebony Prince, the blocked portion is revealed to be a link to a digital copy of the receipt. The digital receipt matches the details (prices and date) of the physical one, seemingly proving the items are not replicas.

The account seemingly wants to sell the items, but Drake/Akademiks claim of them being stolen has made this difficult. They are also taking Etherium (ETH, cryptocurrency) offers for a 30s security footage clip of Drake allegedly doing something bad.

They have publicly threated Drake/Akadmiks with legal action if they do not retract their theft accusations before ""noon Monday 5/13/24"" (time zone unknown, assumed NYC).

However, aside from the first video: they have not posted any proof to backup any of their claims. Every new post leads people to theorize on the alleged clues, but again they have not been backed with any proof.

That is where we currently are as of 5/12/24 06:30 PM PST.

PS: if mods unpin, they aren't censoring. Don't blame them for wanting to keep Kendrick's latest song pinned in addition to their usual daily discussion thread (reddit only allows two pinned posts per sub or one pinned comment per thread). This is supposed to be a music sub, not a conspiracy one.

The laptop is **not** the same as the one seen in J Cole's recent  [beach photo](https://www.tmz.com/2024/05/09/j-cole-beach-tiktok-drake-kendrick-lamar-beef-7-minute-drill/).

The Popular Jewelry online receipt is also non-itemized. The online receipt code was physically blocked by the Nadine Ghosn card in 'meet the grahams' cover art, seemingly proving the receipt and other items are not replicas. The purchaser is ""Drew Ferguson"" who was an [OVO affiliate](https://www.gq.com/story/drake-ovo-sound-42-siriusxm-radio-apollo-theater-show). Their current relationship is seemingly unknown.

**Jimmy Brooks**

>Jimmy Brooks would not have been proud of you that night...

Jimmy Brooks is the name of the 'Degrassi: The Next Generation' character Aubrey (Drake) Graham played. Drake played was on the show from 2001-2009 for 145 episodes.

Notably the character Jimmy Brooks ends up wheelchair-bound.

**Christopher Alvarez**

The ""baby"" in the ""stroller"" is a disabled adult in a mobility wheelchair. Believed to be Christopher Alvarez, a NYC journalist who appeared in a viral video with DJ Khaled.

**Conflicting dates**

Dates printed on the Popular Jewelry receipts are dated July 2023, while the security footage screenshot is timestamped January 2023. This on its own does not prove a hoax:

>*...may this photo help jog your memory as to* ***where*** *you discarded...*

The post could be a visual hint directed at Drake and not a claim that Drake lost the 'meet the grahams' cover items on that specific date.

**The Mark Hotel**

The apparent CCTV footage shows Drake, Christopher Alvarez, and two currently unidentified men in the lobby of The Mark Hotel.

The still image of the footage is timestamped January 22, 2023 03:19:03 AM EDT (?).

The luxury hotel is in close proximity to the Apollo Theater and Barclays Center, where Drake performed during that month.

**Kendrick Lamar NY penthouse**

The video showing off Drake's items, as seen on the 'meet the grahams' cover, was allegedly taken from the same building as Kendrick Lamar's penthouse.

Initial rumors claim the view lines up exactly with Kendrick's penthouse room. The views do seem to line up with the building itself at the very least? See notes below.

Notes:

The video from EbonyPrince2k24 matches [a balcony](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoimJctgqXB/) from  [Harriet's Rooftop & Lounge](https://www.harrietsrooftop.com/).

Assuming the photos of Kendrick's penthouse are still accurate, the video from the post was not taken from there. The railing and floor of the balconies do not match.

The Pierhouse penthouse and Harriet's Lounge seemingly share the same building according to Google Maps. Or are at least two separate buildings that are physically connected.

**The Historical House of Ebony**

The first two X posts include a poster for a dance performance and a logo (?), both belonging the the titular house.

The poster comes from an [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz1WTaxvwtj/?hl=en) (November 19, 2023) by a performative ""ballroom house"" of the same name.

The House of Ebony was featured in an HBO Max show titled 'Legendary,' where multiple houses competed for a prize of USD$100,000. They placed 6th place. The connection to Drake or Kendrick Lamar is seemingly unknown.

[Legendary (TV series) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_(TV_series))

The source of the logo image has zero results through Google Image reverse search or through TinEye reverse image search.

**X banner and profile picture**

The banner is seemingly a logo for the House of Ebony as discussed above.

The profile picture is an icon of the ""African-American Flag.""

I just wanted to share my thoughts on a part of this battle that I don‚Äôt think got a lot of attention.

Let me start off by making something clear, I think Drake lost this battle and it‚Äôs not even up for debate. He lost it for many reasons, including going at others because it didn‚Äôt seem like he had enough on Kendrick, lying and just saying some dumb stuff. However, I think he truly lost when he used AI. Not only is it a slap in the face of music as an art, but it‚Äôs also very disrespectful to Tupac, considering he never received permission from Tupac‚Äôs estate. Even though I believe Drake lost when he used AI, I was still excited to see what he and Kendrick had in store. And to put it simply, Kendrick whooped his ass.

Let‚Äôs get to the main point of this post, Prince (Kendrick Lamar) vs Michael Jackson (Drake). During this battle, this topic of Prince vs Michael Jackson has constantly been brought up by both artists. However, it has also been brought up during their entire careers.

Here are some examples:

Drake on You Only Live Twice:

Not sure if you actually know, but I‚Äôm Michael Jackson.

The man I see in the mirror is actually goin‚Äô platinum.

Kendrick on Mask Off (Remix):

Bitch, my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince).

Drake on Toosie Slide:

I could dance like Michael Jackson.

Kendrick on Real 92.3 Freestyle:

I fluctuate vocals like Prince Rogers.

Drake on Over:

About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these n****s.

Kendrick on Somebody:

A slave with a verse, I feel like Prince Rogers.

Drake on 9:

MJ in every way, I just don‚Äôt fade away.

It is clear to see that Kendrick aligns himself with Prince, while Drake aligns himself with Michael Jackson. However, it‚Äôs important to understand how each of them admire those artists. Kendrick sees himself as Prince because of their artistic abilities. However, Drake sees himself as Michael Jackson because of his commercial success, not his artistic ability.

Also, let me bring something up. I don‚Äôt care how many number one singles Drake has or how many he might get in the future. Access to music today is completely different than what it was during Michael Jackson, Elvis and The Beatles‚Äô day and age. Access to music today is so much easier because of all the modes of delivery compared to what it was a long time ago. I find it more impressive that those artists have the same or more number-one singles than Drake because it was so much harder during their time.

This brings us to today when Kendrick tells Drake: ‚ÄúN****, Prince outlived Mike Jack‚Äô.‚Äù on Metro Boomin and Future‚Äôs Like That. Kendrick isn‚Äôt insulting Michael Jackson (Go and watch his interview with Jimmy Fallon. He respects Michael Jackson.), he‚Äôs saying that Prince was more artistically gifted than Michael Jackson and Michael Jackson was way ahead of Prince when it comes to popularity. Kendrick is telling Drake that, sure you have all the records and you‚Äôre more popular than me, but we aren‚Äôt even close when it comes to artistic value. This is my opinion, but I think artistic value is far more important than popularity and records.

Drake responds on Push Ups with: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a prince to king? He a son, n****.‚Äù This is pretty good response by Drake where he flips the dynamic on Kendrick by calling him his son. Michael Jackson in the King of Pop and a king‚Äôs son is a prince. However, Drake fails to address what Kendrick was referring to. Drake doesn‚Äôt address the point that Kendrick is better than him artistically.

In Kendrick response on Euphoria, he says: ‚ÄúGot a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I‚Äôm Joe, okay.‚Äù I think like most listeners, I didn‚Äôt understand this reference, but after doing some research, this is what I found. Who is Joe? Joe Jackson is Michael Jackson‚Äôs dad and managed his career early on. Benjamin and Jackson could also refer to Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Jackson, two individuals who appear on US currency. However, the main point to takeaway is that Kendrick flips the dynamic back on Drake and call him his son.

The last reference to Prince and Michael Jackson is on Drake‚Äôs Family Matters, he says:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all on your face like what happened to Mike.

Oh shit, it‚Äôs all makin‚Äô sense, maybe I‚Äôm Prince and you actually Mike.

Michael was praying his features would change, get on pop records and rap for the whites.‚Äù

There is a lot to unpack here.

Firstly, Drake is referring to Michael‚Äôs Jackson‚Äôs medical condition that caused him to get white patches on his skin and end up looking white. He‚Äôs implying that Kendrick‚Äôs dark secrets are coming to light. Why the fuck he would make fun of someone‚Äôs medical condition is beyond me.

Secondly, because of Michael Jackson‚Äôs physical condition changing, Drake thinks Michael Jackson wanted to be white (Da fuck?). Drake is implying Kendrick is like Michael Jackson because he has features with Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift to appeal to white audiences.

Lastly, and I think the most damming for Drake. Drake says he‚Äôs actually Prince and Kendrick is actually Michael Jackson. Drake basically admits being Prince is better than Michael Jackson. Your whole career and this entire battle, you wanted to be Michael Jackson, but the moment you see that being Prince is better, you take it. I think Drake shot himself in the foot when he said this. He basically admitted that Kendrick was better than him.

A couple more things to say.

Drake lost this battle on many occasions. Pick your moment. Using AI, bringing up Millie Bobby Brown, bringing up Epstein, admitting that Prince is better than Michael Jackson (Even though you have compared yourself to Michael Jackson your whole career), etc.

Lastly, the only thing Drake is close to when it comes to Michael Jackson is popularity and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs more popular (I explain why earlier in this post). When it comes to artistic value, Drake is not close to Michael Jackson, Prince, or Kendrick.

Matter of fact it's the 3rd language I learnt.
I discovered Kendrick Lamar on the black panther film, I found him pretty dope but I listened to it for Weeknd. + my English wasn't that strong to understand the depth in Kdot's lyrics.

then jump to 2022, when Mr. Morale dropped.

At that time I was into hip-hop that was made in my language (Hindi), I found that pretty dope but I wanted to get into international Hip-hop.

My friend recommended my Mr. Morale, I listened to it. I found it pretty dope.
Honestly this sound was pretty new to my ears.
I started to play KDOT on shuffle and DNA, Humble, Money Trees, Recipe Freestyle became my favs.

I then proceeded to listen to GKMC, initially I didn't like the intro and also the sound was pretty experimental to my ears. Those pitch changes and  complex lyricism.
But after quite some time when I was okay with it, i revisited GKMC and oh god.
shit was movie. It was too good.

I then moved to DAMN.
I found it mid at first tbh, didn't find it quite consistent but it has only grown on me.
Every song excluding GOD, is a banger to me.

I then proceeded to TPAB, which took quite some time to dig and understand, but at last when I peeled all layers off it. I understood the genius that Kendrick is.

I then listened to every single song kendrick has made, I became probably the biggest KDOT fan in my area bro istg.

And this was all during previous year.
This year started with Like that and FUCKKK
what a legendary beef. Not a big drake fan, I think poetic justice was the weakest song for me on GKMC, but dot absolutely bodied drake.

Just to make it clear, I was actively following Pusha T vs Drake at that time although not understanding the most context there was. That was the only beef i followed untill now.

Honestly Kendrick has made a huge impact on the person I'm, and my thoughts as well. his music healed me through the tough times.

[https://x.com/EbonyPrince2k24/status/1789447046493003917](https://x.com/EbonyPrince2k24/status/1789447046493003917)

One of these services is holding lost items. Drake or his crew never picked up the lost items in the required time period so they were most likely sold to someone close to the hotel (EbonyPrince2k24).

EbonyPrince2k24 bought this suitcase from the Mark Hotel and plans to sell the jewlerry and other valuables at the auction before the ball on the 9th of November like he mentioned in this tweet.

[https://x.com/EbonyPrince2k24/status/1789415508736913904](https://x.com/EbonyPrince2k24/status/1789415508736913904)

Drake has now accused EbonyPrince2k24 of stealing the suitcase meaning he can't sell the items at auction ""fucking up his money with lies."" So EbonyPrince2k24 has responded saying that of course there is proof he didn't steal the items because they were held as lost property for the required amount of time according to Forbe's Standards.

EbonyPrince2k24 started his tweets by calling out both Drake and Akademiks because he was the first one to publicise that the suitcase was stolen on stream. I believe he using the CCTV footage as a threat because something bad happened that night to force Drake to retract his statements and shows he is close to the hotel.

**TL;DR**

Drake left a suitcase behind, the hotel stored it and then someone took it because it was left behind to long. EbonyPrince then plans to sell those items but can't because Drake is accusing him of stealing. He also shared some of those times with Kendrick for money.

**Edit:**

**Clarifying my theory**

Some of you raised a good point about Drake being a high profile guest and that most expensive hotels would try return the suitcase. I believe the suitcase was in storage and they maybe did try to return it to Drake however Drake's crew is large and he is constantly moving around and mistakes happen. This lead to the suitcase sitting there for a long period of time. At this point someone realised that they don't need to keep it or return it so they can legally take the suitcase. They saw a potential to make money so took it even if the hotel was still trying to return it or save it for Drake's next stay.

**Does this link to Kendrick?**

No it doesn't EbonyPrince2k24 went through the items and when the beef got big saw an opportunity to sell them to Kendrick also hence him saying ""I am a Black American Capitalist.""He is just good at chasing money he wants to sell the jewelry and when the beef got big he saw a chance to sell what would of been useless items such as pill bottles to Kendrick for money. I think EbonyPrince2k24 is a Kendrick fan and sides with him in the beef and seconds some of Kendricks points such as him calling Drake a culture approriating savage.

**How did he contact Kendrick?**

He lives in New York where Kendrick currently lives and either works or has close connections with a upmarket hotel that regularly deals with celebrities. Someone surely knows someone who knows someone in Kendricks crew.

**When he sold the times to Kendrick**

Someone mentioned earlier that all of Kendricks disses were recorded in the same session meaning he most likely had to contact Kendrick and try sell the proof to him after pushups dropped. This links to this tweet were he says Drake should of kept push ups to himself.

**Update Evidence for the Hotel Lost Property Policy** 

As always take everyone and everything with a grain of salt but this points to what a said earlier.

**New Deleted Tweet**
This tweet was posted I don't know if it was deleted clearly showing the items were left behind the hotel. He says the hotel aways had the same process for lost and found no matter the guest. Drake clearly didn't reply to the contact from the hotel. The picture is a item left behind by an actor from SVU showing it doesn't matter the celeb it's the same process for lost and found.

It has been graciously noted that this is indeed not a ""complete timeline"". As we'd have to cover a lot of ground. Instead, this is more of a ""key moments"" summary, and is intended for those completely out of the loop. This is their starting point:

**2011**: Kendrick features on Drake's *Take Care* album, ""**[Buried Alive Interlude](https://youtu.be/kGO6a0T7f8w)**."" Initial tension hinted in the lyrics.

**2013**: Kendrick ignites the feud with his ""[Control](https://youtu.be/xufJHc2EdBA)"" verse, directly calling out Drake among others.

**2013 BET Awards**: Kendrick **[disses Drake during a cypher](https://youtu.be/YCZfzBa5pkA)**, adding fuel to the fire.

**Oct 6, 2023**: Drake releases ""**[First Person Shooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRs2o36a1Us)**"" on his *For All the Dogs* album, praising his and his peers' status, which Kendrick doesn't appreciate.

**March 22, 2024**: Kendrick responds sharply in ""**[Like That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr1Cdli5nE8)**"" from Future and Metro Boomin's *We Don‚Äôt Trust You*, distancing himself from the ""Big Three"" of rap which includes Drake, leading to escalated tensions.

**April 5, 2024**: J. Cole releases ""**[7 Minute Drill](https://youtu.be/4Ykaf5lgHb0)**"" on his *Might Delete Later* album, which critiques Kendrick's discography but later retracts the diss and apologizes at his Dreamville Festival, reflecting on his statement.

**April 12, 2024**: Future and Metro Boomin drop **[We Still Don‚Äôt Trust You](https://youtu.be/_mSYQ1kadYg)**, featuring tracks from ASAP Rocky and the Weeknd with veiled disses towards Drake, indicating a broadening conflict.

**April 13, 2024:** Drake responds with ""**[Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50)](https://youtu.be/aMr70TH9100)**,"" targeting Kendrick, Future, the Weeknd, J. Cole, Rick Ross, and others in a comprehensive diss track. The track was originally leaked on Saturday, April 13th with many questioning whether it was AI-generated. The official release came out on April 19, 2024.

**April 13, 2024:** Ross releases '**[Champagne Moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH03ruYF8p0)**' to DJ Akademiks, who [quickly featured it on his stream](https://twitter.com/Akademiks/status/1779287691164573784), emphasizing Ross's rapid response to Drake's leaked 'Push Ups (Drop & Give Me 50).' In the track, Ross mocks Drake for alleged ghostwriting, references supposed cosmetic surgery, and criticizes Drake‚Äôs identity and authenticity. He also suggests a deeper betrayal in their relationship by touching on both professional and personal backstories.

**April 19, 2024:** Drake releases '**[Taylor Made](https://youtu.be/vfxfwf-WNQg)**,' a diss track featuring AI-generated vocals of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, aimed at Kendrick Lamar. Shakur's verse criticizes Drake while encouraging Lamar, and Snoop Dogg chides Lamar for his slow response. Drake suggests Lamar's delay is to avoid clashing with Taylor Swift's album release. Following a cease-and-desist from Shakur's estate, which condemned the use of his likeness, Drake removed the song from all platforms.

**April 21, 2024:** Kanye West joins the feud with a remix of '**[Like That](https://youtu.be/WO28_jXYao0)**,' premiered on Justin Laboy‚Äôs radio show. Kanye directly confronts Drake, critiquing his major label deals and the perceived lack of agency over his music, with pointed lyrics about industry control. He also takes a jab at J. Cole, critiquing his influence and appeal. To promote the remix, Kanye shared a [provocative meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jcole/comments/1c8zofc/kanye_west_disses_j_cole_with_instagram_meme_post/) aimed at diminishing J. Cole‚Äôs fanbase. This remix not only escalates the feud but also revives Kanye's personal and professional animosities toward Drake, reflecting their complicated history.

**April 30, 2024:** Kendrick Lamar releases '**[Euphoria](https://youtu.be/NPqDIwWMtxg)**,' a brutal diss track targeting Drake. The song directly addresses Drake's early acting career and presents him as deceitful and manipulative. Kendrick criticizes Drake for exploiting cultural features for personal gain and questions the authenticity of his narratives. The track also indirectly comments on Drake's familial relationships, suggesting that he lacks a genuine understanding of parental responsibilities. Kendrick's lyrics reflect a deep-seated disillusionment with Drake's public persona, contributing to a highly personal edge to their ongoing beef.

**May 3, 2024:** Kendrick Lamar's ""**[6:16 in LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1ypnmTMNqA)**"" drops on Instagram, marking his second diss track aimed at Drake. Lamar takes aim not only at Drake but also at his record label, OVO Sound, marking the first direct attack on them. He suggests infiltration within OVO Sound's ranks, hinting at internal betrayal and secret alliances. Additionally, Lamar cleverly references Drake's hit ""Toosie Slide,"" implying Drake won't be able to smoothly maneuver his way out of the confrontation presented in ""6:16 in LA."" He also playfully mocks Drake's reliance on internet culture, adding depth to their lyrical sparring. The track intensifies the tension between the two rappers, setting the stage for further retaliation and escalating the feud to new heights.

**May 3, 2024:** Drake fires back at Kendrick Lamar with ""**[Family Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXG3ZrXlbc)**,"" a scathing diss track released on multiple platforms. In the song, Drake targets not only Lamar but also several other rappers including Future, Rick Ross, A$AP Rocky, Kanye West, The Weeknd, and Metro Boomin. The track serves as a response to Lamar's recent disses, including ""Champagne Moments,"" ""All to Myself,"" ""Show of Hands,"" ""Euphoria,"" and ""6:16 in LA."" Drake alleges Lamar's involvement in domestic violence against his partner Whitney Alford and suggests infidelity between Alford and Lamar's creative partner Dave Free, even questioning the paternity of one of Lamar's children. Lamar swiftly responds with ""Meet the Grahams"" within 20 minutes of the release of ""Family Matters,"" intensifying their feud. The music video for ""Family Matters"" is rich in symbolism, featuring nods to 50 Cent, Pharrell, and Michael Jackson, along with references to Lamar's personal life, adding layers to the ongoing conflict.

**May 3, 2024:** Kendrick Lamar swiftly counters Drake's ""Family Matters"" with ""**[Meet the Grahams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QiFl9Dc7D0)**,"" ***dropping just 20 minutes*** after Drake's diss track hits the airwaves. Produced by the Alchemist, it delves into a chilling realm with its haunting piano-driven beats. Lamar doesn't hold back, accusing Drake of parental neglect, sexual exploitation, and even running a sex trafficking ring from his mansion, [The Embassy](https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/music/what-embassy-kendrick-lamar-goes-drake-s-family-new-diss-track-meet-grahams). In a shocking twist, Lamar alleges Drake's involvement in child abandonment and brands him a sexual predator. The original cover art, featuring items allegedly stolen from Drake's father and prescription medications with Drake's real name, adds a sinister layer to Lamar's accusations. Though later replaced with a plain black square on streaming platforms due to guidelines, the initial artwork intensifies the track's impact. ""Meet the Grahams"" marks a drastic escalation in their feud, signaling a fierce continuation of their lyrical battle.

**May 4, 2024:** Kendrick Lamar delivers another major blow to Drake with ""**[Not Like Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6eK-2OQtew)**,"" released as his ***third diss track in a thirty-six-hour period***. The song intensifies Lamar's accusations against Drake and his OVO Sound record label, alleging Drake's involvement in pedophilia and child sexual abuse with his associates. Lamar portrays Drake as a cultural appropriator who exploits Atlanta artists for credibility and financial gain. The cover art, featuring a bird's-eye view of Drake's Toronto residence with ""sex-offender map symbols,"" further underscores the track's accusations.

**May 5, 2024:** Drake fires back at Kendrick Lamar with '**[THE HEART PART 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJeY-FXidDQ)**', a potent diss track released on YouTube. Sampling Aretha Franklin, the track features cover art showcasing an Instagram comment from Kendrick's fianc√©e, Whitney Alford, made by Kendrick's manager, Dave Free. Drake addresses domestic violence allegations against Lamar and implicates Free in fathering an illegitimate child with Whitney. **He vehemently denies previous accusations of pedophilia** and claims OVO planted the story about a secret daughter to bait Lamar. The release intensifies their feud, with Metro Boomin reacting and implying Drake is still trailing in their battle.

There's nothing special about him, he's not witty, not catchy, and although he mentions some political issues he never offers any solutions or unique insight.


This is the reason why if you ask a Kendrick fan about his music they can only insult other artists or call you stupid.

Some thoughts:

- **Drake's Universal Music Group Deal:** In 2021, Drake signed a landmark deal with Universal Music Group reportedly worth around $400-500 million, a figure unprecedented in the industry. Given Drake‚Äôs influence, it‚Äôs plausible that his deal included both cash and equity‚Äîa common practice at this level of negotiation. This could potentially give him leverage or ownership over other artists' catalogues under the same corporate umbrella.

- **Sale of Dr. Dre‚Äôs Masters:** Dr. Dre, who has been instrumental in Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs career, sold a portion of his music catalogue, including some rights to Kendrick's works. This sale occurred in 2023 for an undisclosed amount (circa $200m). Since Dre had owned parts of Kendrick‚Äôs masters and publishing rights through Aftermath and Interscope, this transaction might have opened a pathway for Drake to acquire a stake, directly or indirectly. [here](https://variety.com/2023/music/news/dr-dre-selling-catalog-universal-shamrock-1235486661/).

- **Shamrock/UMG Acquisition:** It is possible that Drake could utilise the UMG acquisition by Shamrock Holdings as a cover to anonymously acquire Kendrick‚Äôs rights. This approach would allow him to strategically manage his investments without drawing direct public scrutiny or resistance from sellers.

- **Drake‚Äôs Lyrics:** He has been telling us and giving hints at the strategic acquisition of his rivals' catalogues, echoing a move similar to what Michael Jackson famously did with The Beatles' songs. He‚Äôs not just referring to himself as MJ because of hits. This is the ultimate 'own,' stripping an artist famed for his creativity and disdain of commerce of their ownership. 

As @Dangerous_Orange7159 noted Drake said the following: 

‚ÄúI plan to buy your personal belongings when they up for auction.‚Äù - Omert√†

‚ÄúMan if your pub was up for sale I‚Äôd buy the whole thing.‚Äù - First person shooter

He‚Äôs been hinting at the leverage he has for quite a while. This rumour isn‚Äôt far fetched. ‚Äú

- **The Value of Kendrick‚Äôs Catalogue:** Beyond personal rivalries, Kendrick's catalogue is likely to appreciate over time. Any ongoing conflicts, fueled by public interest and increased streams, would only enhance its value. This is a move that will not only out manoeuvre any lyrical shots thrown at him, but is also good business.

- **Cryptic Messages:** Drake's lyric, ""drop and give me 50,"" was widely interpreted as a reference to Kendrick‚Äôs supposed bad deal with TDE (Top Dawg Entertainment) or a reference to
The video of KDot doing pushups, alluding to a contentious 50% ownership. While it's unlikely Drake actually owns 50% of Kendrick‚Äôs catalogue, it is possible he has a portion and the lyric symbolises control and ownership, a ""nuclear"" move in their ongoing rivalry.

Drake's team is known for being strategic, calculated, and sometimes ruthless. This narrative not only reflects the cutthroat nature of the music business but also a battle that has been slow cooking for a minute - Drake is prepared, and won‚Äôt make the mistake he did with Pusha again - he is prepared and waiting. 

Drake is using his deal with UMG to position himself as the modern-day Michael Jackson of music catalogue ownership. This might explain why industry insiders are increasingly polarised around him. Joe Budden has alluded to this on a recent podcast and Drake seems to be taunting for a response.

As the pieces move behind the music scene's closed doors, it‚Äôs clear that the battle isn‚Äôt just lyrical‚Äîit‚Äôs financial and deeply strategic. 

Drake is petty and playing chess.

He was 14 years old and he was excited for highschool. He one day runs to school and sees one kid getting bullied, that kid name was Drake, and the bully was named Kanye West, who was racially motivated.  Kendrick Lamar, despite being 10 years younger than him, he could not stand this injustice and said:

-Hey bully, why don't you pick someone of your side
-HAH, laughed Kanye, funny that you mention size, shortie!

That was the last straw for Kendrick. Suddenly, he uses his raping super powers, who were so deep and powerful that it made Kanye shit himself and run away. Everyone was in shock, they could not believe there eyes someone could be this powerful. Drake looks at Kendrick and says:

-thank you for saving me
-no problem
-you know, im also a rapper, and I'd like to say, you impressed me
-we should be friends!
-not just friends, but best friends!

And they became best friends and decided to watch the latest episode of spongebob after school. To them joined J Cole, who was coincidentally good friends with both of them and they decided to watch spongebob all three of them

-we are like a crew! says drake
-no, we are even more... we are a big three! says kendrick
-you is a genius, kendrick! says J Cole.
-just call me kdot! says kendrick

But little did they know how tragic their friendship will end, but that's a story for other day

Both artists are pulling similar play counts on their latest tracks, showing no clear winner like in the days of ""Back to Back"" where Drake's dominance was unmistakable.


The truth is, **Kendrick, despite throwing his best shots, is far from ending Drake's career**. This scene is a battle of equals rather than a knockout, it‚Äôs clear that both artists continue to hold their ground strongly.


And let‚Äôs not forget, Drake is known for bouncing back with hit albums, way more consistently than Kendrick, just like he did with Scorpion.

1. In 6:16 in LA, Kendrick warned Drake that members of Drake's team were providing Kendrick with dirt. If not Drake's team, then¬†*who*¬†provided Kendrick with the dirt about the non-existent child?
2. If the child does exist, where is she? Why didn't Kendrick bring out receipts proving her existence on the track he released the next day, immediately after Drake's denial?
3. Why did Kendrick remove the cover art of MTG from DSPs if he wasn‚Äôt baited with fake receipts by Drake's team?¬†
4.

For those unfamiliar, both pods have hosts who are within the hip hop industry, and typically get insider information. Mal was personally invited to the last show of Drakes tour a few days ago. 

Hosts from both podcasts (Joe and Mal)  have insinuated or stated that they‚Äôve received information that Drake has already recorded the track, and for those that heard it, it is an absolutely murderous track, and will flip the whole script. Joe, who many believe is a Drake hater, has even expressed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doubting your pen Kenny, but you gotta tighten all the way up for what the rumors are about this track‚Äù. He also made it clear to point out that his sources are real rappity rappers and listeners, not just randoms in the industry. Mal said ‚ÄúI promise you this isn‚Äôt going to go how y‚Äôall (Drake haters) think it‚Äôs going to go‚Äù.  Rory joked at some point in the pod ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôve heard it‚Äù and Mal gave an evasive non answer. 

The issue now is, Mal was making the argument that Like That was childs play to Drake and his camp. They believe Kendrick already has more disses recorded, so they want him to drop an actual actual diss that‚Äôs longer and more direct, so Drake can drop his. 

This is all really exciting information. Kendrick and Drake are probably my personal top 2 (or 3 Tyler‚Äôs in there somewhere). I have the utmost respect for Drake‚Äôs rapping ability and Drake‚Äôs pen. Songs like Duppy freestyle and Back to Back are a prime example that he‚Äôs that dude when it comes to diss tracks. It‚Äôs insane to me how slept on his pen is by so many people. While I‚Äôm a Kendrick fan, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Drake wins these verbal tussles, and believe he‚Äôs more battle tested. He has way more rap beef evidence to point to than Kendrick. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm a bit worried by the fall out. Kendrick losing to Drake isn‚Äôt a huge L to me, but to all of those who for some reason don‚Äôt respect Drake‚Äôs pen? For all the Kendrick Stan‚Äôs who don‚Äôt know? For all of those who expect Kendrick to win and hold him as a better lyricist (which is a LOT of people)? That could cause irreparable damage to Kendrick in a more severe way than Drake is at risk of imo. It can get messy but it‚Äôs exciting.

I genuinely don‚Äôt think they would secede a loss to ANYTHING. Like what beat Drake with Pusha was saying Drake‚Äôs parents got divorced, he doesn‚Äôt know family, is hiding a child, and that he used ghost writers before. 


Would talking about Kendrick speaking of loyalty and cheating on his wife work? Probably not, would saying Kendrick ghost writes for his cousin work? Probably not. 


They already say talking about Drake being more commercially successful means nothing to them, no one listening to Mr.Morale after it just came out other than hardcore fans means nothing to them. 


I just think they have Kendrick on such a pedestal they won‚Äôt accept any criticism as valid. Does Drake just have to have secret gossip tabloid information for it to be a good diss?


If he comes out with something great they will just say ghost writers made it. When I see them talk about him on their sub I know they‚Äôre clowning but no one can admit Drake has any good lyrics. They really cherry pick like crazy, say stuff like the guy who‚Äôs a lesbian is a good rapper?


If Drake drops a diss it will go viral, everyone will listen to it. Then no matter how successful it is the main stream rap discourse will just talk about how it‚Äôs pathetic Drake shot back, either he‚Äôll have gone too far or he won‚Äôt have said enough. 


If Kendrick fans can‚Äôt admit there‚Äôs anything anyone could ever say to take down their favourite rapper, then they aren‚Äôt worth talking about.

 This sub is having fun about the beef. Ross posts his shit and people are laughing, BBL Drizzy posts are upvoted and we make jokes about it. I guess that‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôve survived years of Drake being roasted and clowned.

We know throughout the track Kendrick Lamar is calling Drake a fake gangster, saying he‚Äôs a fraud who acts tough. 

But the track gets more intresting and deeper towards the end.

Kendrick says near the end:

‚ÄúYeah, OV-ho n***** is dick riders
Tell 'em run to America, they imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence‚Äù

He‚Äôs calling out Toronto gangs for being fake, imitators of American culture. More specifically he‚Äôs calling out Toronto gangs for imitating LA GANG culture. As he says ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt imitate this violence‚Äù

Then he starts mocking the Toronto accent and the slang. 

‚ÄúDon't speak on the family, crodie
It can get deep in the family, crodie
Talk about me and my family, crodie?
Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie‚Äù

He‚Äôs mocking them for the word ‚Äúcrodie‚Äù which is taken from the LA slang ‚Äúbrodie‚Äù, obviously changed from ‚Äúb‚Äù to ‚Äúc‚Äù because of the Crips in Toronto.

Kendrick is mocking Toronto gangs for being imitators of LA gangs and saying that they aren‚Äôt a threat.

This is when it gets deeper. He says:

 ‚ÄúI be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and blamy, crodie
Tell me you're cheesin', fam
We can do this right now on the camera, crodie‚Äù

New Ho King is a Chinese Resturant on Spadina Avenue in Toronto. New Ho King is ALSO where a Toronto rapper named Sizzlac filmed his last music video before being shot and killed.

Sizzlac got shot and killed days after dropping a diss record titled ‚ÄúRealest in the 6‚Äù, and in the music video for the record he‚Äôs at New Ho King.

Sizzlac is also rumored to be one of the people that robbed Drake at gunpoint in 2009. Drake got robbed in 2009 by two people at gunpoint and it‚Äôs been rumored for a long time that one of them was Sizzlac. Also supposedly Drake was going to file a police report, but didn‚Äôt because it would effect his rap career being labeled as a snitch. Remember Kendrick said ‚ÄúI know some shit about n***** that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint‚Äù. 

Drake got robbed and his chain was snatched after being set up by a girl. He raps about it in a few of his songs like ‚ÄúThe Reaistance‚Äù or ‚ÄúAway From Home‚Äù.

Drake recently has aligned himself with another Toronto rapper named Pressa. He brought him out on tour a few years ago and shouted him out on his latest album For All The Dogs. 

Pressa is apart of the Driftwood CRIPS gang. 

The Driftwood Crips and Sizzlacs gang have had a long rivalry.

Pressa said in his song Attachments, ‚ÄúSizzlac dead, and they don't post him on the 'Gram‚Äù

No one knows who shot and killed Sizzlac, it‚Äôs all rumors that it could have been someone from his gang or other gangs that killed him. 

So, when Kendrick says that he‚Äôs at New Ho King with a blammy and that he can do it on camera. He‚Äôs saying that unlike Sizzlac, he‚Äôs in Drakes city (Toronto) at New Ho King with a gun and that he‚Äôs ready to do it on camera.

He also mocks the Toronto Crips (Driftwood Crips/Pressas Crew) by making fun of their slang, accent and calling them fake imitators of LA gang culture.

Kendrick saw that Drake has been aligning himself with these Crips in his city of Toronto (maybe even being involved in Sizzlacs death after getting robbed for his chain) and called Drakes BS. He called the Crips in his city fake, made fun of them for copying LA culture while also saying he‚Äôs at New Ho King with a gun and that Drake won‚Äôt do anything about it. 

This also ties in with him calling Drake a culture vulture throughout the track and is a direct response to Drake using LA legends AI voices like Pac and Snoop to diss Kendrick. ‚ÄúI'd rather do that than let a Canadian n**** make Pac turn in his grave‚Äù. Drake has been saying he‚Äôs bigger then Kendrick in LA, mocking him for supposedly being the ‚ÄúWest Coast Savior‚Äù so Kendrick returns fire by making fun of Toronto.



Also remember when Drake said:

‚ÄúHugs and kisses, man, don't tell me 'bout no switches
I'll be rockin' every fuckin' chain I own next visit, ayy‚Äù?

He says he‚Äôll rock every chain he owns on his next visit to LA. This could play into Kendrick with the subliminal Sizzlac reference, since he supposedly robbed Drakes chain in Toronto (his own city). 

Right at the end of the track Kendrick says: ‚ÄúThey punk y‚Äôall n*****, nobody never took my food‚Äù 

Reference to New Ho King and Drake (and Sizzlac) both getting punked in Toronto.

You have to be an absolute drake glazer to disagree, this beef is over, at least on wax. The winner is indisputably Kendrick Lamar.

We will definitely see fall out from all this, but this phase is over. I dont wanna hear no more debates. 

Edit: Peep game since I see this comment floating around a lot (and rightfully so). 

I am not saying Kendrick is telling the truth, and Drake is lying. I am saying I believe Kendrick over Drake any day. There is a reason why Kendrick's narrative is overtaking Drake's. Pusha said it best ""We talkin' character"".

Kendrick has proven throughout his career what kind of man he is. Overall, he is trustworthy and has been spotless of scandals. Drake, on the other hand, has been caught lying multiple times. Has actual links to possible pedophilia, his persona is all about sex and using women (I mean, look at his CLB cover), and many more things as to why people are more likely to believe Kendrick and doubt Drake. 

Yes, if someone comes with proof, then the tides can turn, but that probably isn't going to happen. Drake is reaping and sowing. What is making him lose in this beef now is his character. This is why Kendrick wins. 

Edit 2: This man went and dropped a Dj Mustard produced club banger now. It really is over. Drake needs Jesus at this point. 

Edit 3: Drake just dropped. It is officially over. The dude needed to come with a guillotine and came with a paper cut. The Heart part 6 is a white flag.

Kenny said ""Money, power, respect... the last one is better""... He's implying that Drake has more money, more power (if Drake owns the other artists' masters), but if any artist is more unanimously respected, not just in the rap world but in general, it is Kendrick Lamar. That is undeniable. And Kenny is saying that respect is of the utmost importance to him. 

I've always sensed an intense competitive drive in Kendrick, since the beginning of his career. He wants to be the best, he wants to fight his competitors for the top spot, in the true spirit of hip hop. Kendrick loves rap and all that it stands for. He's definitely not the one to cower away when things get serious. This is one tough mf. 

If anything, he should be more motivated to battle Drake because of the rage he probably feels because of the whole situation. There is no way on this planet that he would back out after Drake called out his wife, and all the other insults. For heaven's sake, Kendrick's album cover is him standing in front of his wife with a gun strapped to him for her protection. 

Some are saying that Kendrick didn't know about the red button before he dissed Drake on Like That. I just don't see how that could happen.

I‚Äôm a fan of all 3. Their influence over the game since about 2010 has shaped hip-hop/rap tremendously. Kendrick once again is igniting the fires that‚Äôs going to turn the game upside down. Do I think his verse and we don‚Äôt trust you he‚Äôs the best he‚Äôs ever came up with? No I don‚Äôt. However, I do feel that it‚Äôs a starter to ignite something bigger while Drake has beefed and held his own with people in the past, I don‚Äôt think this is something he can get away with, and win if he ends up getting involved or responds back. J. Cole, however, is a different story me.

Looking at J. Cole and Kendrick together is like looking at biggie and 2Pac. In that debate, everyone will say 2Pac was better than biggie all day, but we never got to see biggies full potential as he died to soon. While we‚Äôve all seen how hard and harsh kendrick can be, I believe J. Cole is one not to overlook either.

It almost seems as if he holds back so that he doesn‚Äôt get too involved with rap beef, but has expressed in past songs that he‚Äôs willing to do so if necessary. 

Maybe this is Kendricks way of challenging J. Cole to see if he can back up all that talk or not.

‚ÄúMeet The Grahams‚Äù was beautifully executed with Kendrick dissing Drake through conversations with his family members over a horror film instrumental that left many shocked and speechless. The way Kendrick spoke softly toward Adonis, the alleged daughter and Sandi but raised his voice at Dennis and Aubrey was a chef‚Äôs kiss. Then ‚ÄúNot Like Us‚Äù was just a party anthem that‚Äôll probably do really well on the charts. None of these songs sound the same, each have something distinct and special.

I also think trying to frame Kendrick as a rac*st who hates white people, fell hard. Kendrick‚Äôs issue with Drake has to do with him emulating black American culture despite growing up with white relatives in the suburbs of Canada. And Drake had no rebuttal because it‚Äôs true. Instead he took the cheap route of ‚ÄúKendrick slept with white women because he‚Äôs insecure,‚Äù like Kendrick didn‚Äôt already tell us that two years ago. Drake‚Äôs most damning bars are all speculation with zero merit. 

If you‚Äôre going to win a rap battle then you need to make your claims and prove them through a mix of confirmed situations (with witnesses or police reports) and speculation. Kendrick is claiming that Drake is a fake tough guy who abu*es women and capitalises off black culture. So far, he‚Äôs used both confirmed situations as well as speculation. And he‚Äôs done it in an engaging way without resorting to social media gimmicks to win over listeners. He‚Äôs showing Drake that he‚Äôs in a different league. 

Regardless of what happens, people need to give Kendrick his credit as a songwriter and musician. While Drake is comfortable using familiar beats and flows, Kendrick is experimenting with every track. If only he could release music videos for each track could he add so many more layers to his disses. This is the same man who made an entire song revolving around two people arguing.

i‚Äôm not saying that this is true for Drake - i think he really put his best foot forwards towards this beef (AND Pusha T, i think that Duppy Freestyle is often very overlooked) - i just think that K. Dot (and Push) both did MUCH better. 

so - serious question - what makes you think that Drake won?

rumors and gossip to the side ‚Ä¶ i know that music is subjective‚Ä¶ but if we look at all tracks, i think kendrick had the more creative, hard hitting attacks and strategies that dissected drake‚Äôs character. it certainly seems like the public perception of drake is changing (even more so than when pusha t went after him, maybe due to the popularity of kendrick‚Äôs music).

Its so bad that even last year during the 50th anniversary of hip hop MC Hammer, a whole legend, did not attend any ceremonies because he was ostracized during his career for his fun approach to hip hop. Even Will Smith is hardly recognized as a pioneer/real MC.

But, as someone who grew up loving the genre, there are certainly some key things you have to have to really be a ‚Äúrapper‚Äù or MC in the traditional sense. One of the biggest is you HAVE to be writing your shit. Pop or other genres are different, in that vocal range and sound play a huge part of the song‚Äôs success so lots of songs get written for good singers. But rap is supposed to be real. It‚Äôs about your genuine emotions in your voice.

I say all that to say, I was done with Drake when he battled Meek. There have been some songs he‚Äôs made I liked fine, but the ghostwriters were it for me. Not just that he had them, but when it was exposed he played it off like everyone does it all the time. Real MCs would never steal someone‚Äôs music (writing credits is a bit different, especially if it‚Äôs help with a hook or one rhyme obviously). He‚Äôs a pop star who pretends to be a rapper for his ‚Äúbrand‚Äù. I guess what kills me is I thought HE knew that, and that was why he never tried Kendrick, Cole, Em, etc. because those guys are clearly different from you.

From what we know, he‚Äôs possibly the cleanest rapper out here. He doesn‚Äôt do hard substances or have a plethora of baby mothers etc. Kendrick is focused on making generational music, raising his family and he putting on his associates. 

In contrast, Aubrey is in his mid-30s, gallivanting around with 25 year old models in The Bahamas wondering why nobody is taking him seriously. He‚Äôs texting and potentially grooming teenagers, had a child with an adult star, possibly fumbled Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. There‚Äôs also Instagram models who have come out and called Drake corny and lame.

In hip-hop your diss tracks actually need substance and I don‚Äôt know what Drake can say about K Dot that Kendrick hasn‚Äôt said himself. He admitted to his infidelity, to having daddy issues, to sexual trauma within his family etc. in a way that was very heartfelt and not something you can use as ‚Äúdiss‚Äù material. Meanwhile, Drake has alot of skeletons in his closet. 

If Kendrick really put on his gloves and wanted to decimate Drake he could. Meanwhile, Aubrey will respond with ‚ÄúI took you on tour once and sell more than you.‚Äù The same goes for Cole, he‚Äôs nowhere near as accomplished as Kendrick in terms of accolades, classic albums or even popularity with Kendrick having 10M+ listeners on Spotify. 

Again, no idea what Cole can say besides ‚ÄúI helped you early on in your career,‚Äù and that‚Äôs where the argument ends. I don‚Äôt know why supporters of either fanbase want this with Kendrick who can also talk about the fact that Drake isn‚Äôt respected by the OGs in the rap game. While his fanbase doesn‚Äôt care, Drake does and has mentioned it on several occasions.

On Like That Kendrick makes no mention of anything personal, doesn‚Äôt even allude to it. Strictly on some competition shit with Drake and Cole. Both Drake and Cole take it personally and start saying personal shit. Drake gets on Pushups and attacks the dispute he had over his label. We all know artists get real emotional about label disputes because it affects everything about their career(Lil Uzi Vert and Megan Thee Stallion come to mind for me with how vocal they were against their labels) and warns him at the end ‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt everything he know don‚Äôt let the demon out‚Äù threatening Kendrick that he will take it there with no prior threats made in the same fashion against him on Like That. Cole comes at his album collection calling his last few drops not all that, but realizes his mistake about making it personal and opts out knowing what‚Äôs about to come next(Likely because KDot respects him, he gets a warning from Kendrick‚Äôs team to stay out of the way)

TaylorMade freestyle should have been his initial response without the AI shit (Though it was funny) all 3 verses should have been his. Nothing personal, pretty great bars and coming at Kendrick in a way that doesn‚Äôt provoke any of what‚Äôs going on now. I personally think had all 3 verses had been his it‚Äôd be a strong track.

Drake gets personal, Kendrick has to as well. He responds with Euphoria calling Drake a culture vulture, saying he identifies as a woman and some bars about Adonis. Personal but light stuff compared to what comes next. He even warns Drake twice let‚Äôs not go there let‚Äôs keep it strictly competitive rap. These were just warning shots. Pushups was also warning shots but were fired seemingly for no reason as again Kendrick showed no implication of going low on Like That.

Kendrick drops another warning shot of hey let‚Äôs not go there with 6.16 saying he has moles in OVO(unconfirmed whether they were real or feeders) basically warning Drake again let‚Äôs keep this rap because I know guys who know things.

And then the explosion happens: Drake drops Family Matters which is just the most personal shit of the beef so far. Doubled down on what he‚Äôs said before, calls Kendrick a woman beater and then says his child isn‚Äôt his. We all know now this was his red button and he pushed it for literally no reason after Kendrick said let‚Äôs keep this rap multiple times. Kendrick had to know this was coming likely from one of his Moles and released meet the grahams like 20 minutes later. People say the beef went dark here but no, Family Matters made it dark Kendrick just made it pitch black after being provoked. And then follows Not Like Us and Part 6. Kendrick even says in meet the grahams this was supposed to be a friendly exhibition but you had to mention my family.

From the onset of this beef Kendrick never wanted to go dark but he had the ammo and angles to take it there. This was never about just rap to Drake, he took it there from the onset in Pushups.",False,False,rap,Why do a lot of Drake fans push a narrative that Kendrick made this beef personal and dangerous for their images,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1cn8uhz/why_do_a_lot_of_drake_fans_push_a_narrative_that/

Drake started the beef with Push Ups which then got 2 responses : Euphoria and 6:16 In LA. In both tracks Kendrick begs him to keep it friendly because he knows a lot of shit about Drake.

At this point Drake has 2 options for his response : keep it hiphop or get personal. For some reason, he thought making it a personal beef would be better. I don't know if it's because he thought Kendrick was bluffing or because he thought his red button was more dangerous, but it just doesn't make sense for him to make this decision. Worst case scenario in a purely hiphop rap beef is people acknowledge you as a worse rapper than Kendrick which most people already do. You essentially have all to gain and nothing to lose in a purely hiphop beef, whereas making it personal puts you under the risk of having your brand and public image getting damaged. 

Now I know if you're as big as Drake, you probably have enough ego to think you won't we touched. BUT MF THIS HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TO YOU. A guy has already hurt your image in the same way. You'd think that this would help Drake learn from his mistakes and approach this differently.

I searched Reddit and the rest of the internet and the outrage about this feels...tepid. In fact, the reddit threads were mostly thinking that the track was lame for using AI (I agree) but not overly upset that Drake seemingly used other artist's voices without any permission in the first place.

Why aren't consumers and artists themselves completely up in arms about this? Are they and I'm just not searching the right places? I read one short interview with Snoop about this and his reaction was essentially,  ""meh.""

However, after diving into Drake's latest track, I couldn't help but feel that while the title was brilliant, the execution fell a bit short. But it got me thinking - what if Drake had fully realized the potential of his concept?

Remember the mind-bending visuals from ""The Hearth pt 5,"" where Kendrick's face morphed into Kanye's and others? What if Drake had used a similar technique to explore different perspectives in his hypothetical ""The Hearth pt 6""?

Here's how I envision it:

1. **Kendrick's Wife**: Imagine Drake rapping from the perspective of Kendrick's wife, delving into themes of heartbreak and alleged abuse. References to past songs like ""Opposites attract"" or ""This girl is an alien"" could add depth, painting a vivid picture of her alienation and pain.
2. **Dave Free**: Switching to a grittier beat, Drake could embody Dave Free's persona, portraying Kendrick as just a mere butterfly that he and Top Dog pimped for profits, a commodity in the music industry. This track could touch on sensitive topics like the son allegations, exposing the darker side of the industry.
3. **The Mole**: What if Drake had been the one feeding Kendrick information? Picture a duet where Drake and the mole mock Kendrick for taking the bait, adding a layer of irony and intrigue to the narrative.
4. **Kendrick's Son**: Drake could channel Kendrick's son, seeking ""poetic justice"" regarding the allegations against Dave Free. This angle could add a poignant twist, exploring the complexities of loyalty and betrayal.

While this concept is undeniably bold, it's worth considering whether it might cross certain boundaries. Some of the examples may indeed be too extreme, pushing the envelope of artistic expression.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this hypothetical scenario. Can you imagine other ""faces"" Drake could have used to further explore this idea?

I answer objectively - ""Kenny MAY have better lyrics but Drake is not getting dethroned!"" 

I favor Drake's music over K.'s but I recognize that his pen is on a different level. That's not even bringing the OVO Sweatshop into the mix. At Drake's best, he's not a wordsmith like Kendrick is. Not close...BUUUUUT!!!! Drake makes bangers! He has transcended hip hop and maintained his place on top. Rap is a ruled by youth. It's always out with the old and in with the new. Very few have dominated this genre for a decade or more. Drake not only did so but created a symbiotic relationship with each new wave! Dude literally did a song or toured with soooo many artists just to put them on! No one talks about the love he's continuously showed the new school. Calling him a culture vulture for this was so off-putting to me! On top of everything, Drake's cataloge is bananas! From now all the way back to Ransom with Wayne or Successful with Trey Songs! His music reaches a large audience, he sings (ehh), acts, raps, is funny af, handles business and takes care of his day 1s. All while shitting on everyone every time he drops. At some point, I would expect people to understand. If it hasn't happened yet it WON'T! The only artist who has the ability to mop Drake doesn't have the desire to and has verbalized that Drake will always be in his good graces. I took that as another checkmate move from Aubrey. I give dude his flowers. Yes, Kenny raps better but it's bigger than rap. They are attacking one another's character at this point. Ye's crazy ass couldn't touch Drake. Kendrick hasn't stood a chance. 

Also, let's be real real! J Cole has the ability to wash them both, lyrically. No debate. Not sure why he doesn't want to but I respect him for bowing out. I find Cole's music slightly dull but I have ears! Cole would Mr. Miyagi, wax on wax off they ass at the same time if he wanted to. These are not opinions. Rap is the only art form I know of that can be measured. Disecting and analyzing the complexity and reach of lyrics, comprehensiveness, ability to story tell, types of rhymes used, how often, subject matter, cultural impact, etc... These are all measurable feats. The sales/streams are an aspect of the equation, yes, but they matter less than one may think. Eminem is quite literally the best rapper to date.

As far as my experience with Drake so far: I remember when ‚ÄúHotline Bling‚Äù was popular and I thought it was a boring song.

Meet the Grahams TD 7 

31 - 17 Kdot 

Seemingly not happy the lead Kendrick drops again and score easily with not like us. 

Not Like Us TD 7 

38 - 17 Kdot 


Drakes camp and his fans are in despair. 

Rightfully so. Not Like us us easily a banger and Seemingly puts the game out of reach.

The Heart Pt 6 - TD 7 

Drake needed to score more points but did not release enough songs to keep pace with Kendrick later in the game. 

The game ends 38 - 24. 

It was a decisive victory for Kendrick, but he did give up points to Drake.

Kendrick makes music that aspires for political change, dives into our inner pains and struggles, and tells vivid stories that only a few rappers can do. I have heard Cole do the same, and shit's fucking good but nowhere near as deep, as developed, and as detailed as Kendrick puts it. 

Drake tho...I never understood why he's become as popular as he is right now. I attribute it to him leaning to R&B and pop these days. I don't see any rap DNA in his music anymore aside from a few tracks. 

There are so many great and classic songs in Kendrick's discography like The Blacker The Berry, Sing For Me, A.D.H.D., The Art of Peer Pressure, good kid, FEEL., FEAR., DUCKWORTH., Mirror, Count Me Out, The Heart Part 5, and more.

2. He said KDot is a fake activist who‚Äôs never down anything for his city, yet all you need to do is do a quick Google search to see this is false. Kendrick gives back to his community he just avoids publicity. 

3. He denied ever looking at a teenager twice on the Heart Part VI, but there‚Äôs faaarrrrr too much evidence over the years to show that this is false.

Kendrick successfully sold the narrative that he‚Äôs connected to a mole in OVO because he dropped Meet the Grahams not even an hour after Family Matters, and the title of the song was clearly a reference to Drake‚Äôs.

So far the only thing Kendrick may have been dishonest about was the line about Drake smashing Wanye‚Äôs girl while he was in prison( Wayne said it happened before he dated her), but that was likely a case of stretching the truth for a reaction.

Some thoughts:

- **Drake's Universal Music Group Deal:** In 2021, Drake signed a landmark deal with Universal Music Group reportedly worth around $400-500 million, a figure unprecedented in the industry. Given Drake‚Äôs influence, it‚Äôs plausible that his deal included both cash and equity‚Äîa common practice at this level of negotiation. This could potentially give him leverage or ownership over other artists' catalogues under the same corporate umbrella.

- **Sale of Dr. Dre‚Äôs Masters:** Dr. Dre, who has been instrumental in Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs career, sold a portion of his music catalogue, including some rights to Kendrick's works. This sale occurred in 2023 for an undisclosed amount (approx $200m). Since Dre had owned parts of Kendrick‚Äôs masters and publishing rights through Aftermath and Interscope, this transaction might have opened a pathway for Drake to acquire a stake, directly or indirectly. [here](https://variety.com/2023/music/news/dr-dre-selling-catalog-universal-shamrock-1235486661/).

- **Shamrock/UMG Acquisition:** It is possible that Drake could utilise the UMG acquisition by Shamrock Holdings as a cover to anonymously acquire Kendrick‚Äôs rights. This approach would allow him to strategically manage his investments without drawing direct public scrutiny or resistance from sellers.

- **Drake‚Äôs Lyrics:** He has been telling us and giving hints at the strategic acquisition of his rivals' catalogues, echoing a move similar to what Michael Jackson famously did with The Beatles' songs. He‚Äôs not just referring to himself as MJ because of hits. This is the ultimate 'own,' stripping an artist famed for his creativity and disdain of commerce of their ownership. 

As @Dangerous_Orange7159 noted Drake said the following: 

‚ÄúI plan to buy your personal belongings when they up for auction.‚Äù - Omert√†

‚ÄúMan if your pub was up for sale I‚Äôd buy the whole thing.‚Äù - First person shooter

He‚Äôs been hinting at the leverage he has for quite a while. This rumour isn‚Äôt far fetched. ‚Äú

- **The Value of Kendrick‚Äôs Catalogue:** Beyond personal rivalries, Kendrick's catalogue is likely to appreciate over time. Any ongoing conflicts, fueled by public interest and increased streams, would only enhance its value. This is a move that will not only out manoeuvre any lyrical shots thrown at him, but is also good business.

- **Cryptic Messages:** Drake's lyric, ""drop and give me 50,"" was widely interpreted as a reference to Kendrick‚Äôs supposed bad deal with TDE (Top Dawg Entertainment) or a reference to
The video of KDot doing pushups, alluding to a contentious 50% ownership. While it's unlikely Drake actually owns 50% of Kendrick‚Äôs catalogue, it is possible he has a portion and the lyric symbolises control and ownership, a ""nuclear"" move in their ongoing rivalry.

Drake's team is known for being strategic, calculated, and sometimes ruthless. This narrative not only reflects the cutthroat nature of the music business but also a battle that has been slow cooking for a minute - Drake is prepared, and won‚Äôt make the mistake he did with Pusha again - he is prepared and waiting. 

Drake is using his deal with UMG to position himself as the modern-day Michael Jackson of music catalogue ownership. This might explain why industry insiders are increasingly polarised around him. Joe Budden has alluded to this on a recent podcast and Drake seems to be taunting for a response.

As the pieces move behind the music scene's closed doors, it‚Äôs clear that the battle isn‚Äôt just lyrical‚Äîit‚Äôs financial and deeply strategic. 

Drake is petty and playing chess.

That is a pretty good shot too. Calling out Kendrick being Top's bitch is an angle no one predicted, that too with a bop ass hook. 

But Kendrick literally said ""Money, Power, Respect - the last one is better"", ie he is more focused on the respect he garners than money or power. So Drake whaling in on him about Money and Power seems very much redundant. Kendrick's shots have always been about respect. Even as far back as the BET Cypher shot at Drake -

""And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you, high-five
I'm bulletproof, your shots will never penetrate""

He is insinuating the same thing. The shots Drake can take are about Money or Power, but Kendrick is immune to that and is focusing solely on Respect from his peers. He's not just giving more ammo to Kendrick to call out Drake's insecurity about not being respected, he is basically talking to a wall about Money and Power when Kendrick straight up dips for half a decade from the hip hop scene just because he felt like doing that, and comes back with an album that's completely about his own self reflection that not everyone would vibe with. That is someone who doesn't give a shit about staying relevant or making bag. He even has entire songs about making money but feeling like he failed Compton. Even the verse about Uncle Sam in Wesley's Theory or Lucifer in Alright hits the same thought, where Money and Power are shown as traps. So Drake talking about having money and power seems shallow as far as Kendrick is concerned. 

This feels like the last battle of 8 Mile but Clarence doesn't choke and gives a verse about how Rabbit is trailer park trash. It can be a mad verse, but it still doesn't hold any weight when the man just said he doesn't give a shit about that. Clarence knows this and the audience knows this, hence he chokes there. Same can be said about Eminem himself. Almost everyone dissing him goes at him being white, which is just easy ammo for him to fire back. 

I'm hoping Drake goes deeper than this whenever the next round pops because finding an angle to attack Kendrick itself is a feat, and he did that. Now he has to stop with the shallow cuts and look for the chinks in Kendricks armour and attack that.

Family Matters is a good response imho, He goes at everybody again. Throws out some crazy accusations of his own. And some hilarious bars I think you all know what im referring to. The Heart Part 6. Was meh at best just clearing the air over the pedo accusations with a few jabs thrown in.

I think of the worse things that can happen for an artist in a rap beef is that their opponents song becomes a radio hit and that‚Äôs what Not Like Us has become at least on the west coast.

For me, I can't unsee some of the pictures drake painted of kendrick. Drake telling him the whole world gasses him and makes excuses for him was relevant AF. Every day I see that happen. This idea of him calling himself a prophet but smacking around his BM behind the scenes was also wild. Also how he exploited kendricks rocky relationship, being away from his kids etc and living in NY, and how his Girl has yet to say anything @ all about the whole situation lol.

The beef is believed to have started with Kendrick feature on the song, Like That, which was part of the Future x Metro Boomin recent collaboration album. Kendricks Verse was made in the vain of a similar verse on a previous collaborations he did with Big Sean and Jay Electronica, Control. On Like That, Kendrick spit the normal braggadocio lines, but in particular this line stood out.

‚ÄúMotherfuck the Big Three, N\*\*\*\* it‚Äôs just Big me!‚Äù

The Big Three being a reference to the belief that Him, J.Cole, and Drake are the Big 3 of Hip Hop at the moment, J.Cole being a fellow notable rapper who recently collaborated with Drake on the song, First Person Shooter, and has done so with Kendrick a fair bit in the past. Now anyone with actual sense would understand that this bar is the same one Kendrick done with control, it being not an attack, but a friendly spar, an invitation to show him that they also deserve the title, like Kendrick done before. Kendrick being known for being, while friendly, very competitive person.

And while J.Cole seems to have understood that, along with most of the industry, Drake did not. Drake having been known for being EXTREMELY thin skinned and vindictive to any kind of criticism laid his way, no doubt cause by the, legitimately hateful at times, disrespect he received early in his career. It didn‚Äôt help that many other rappers would post short instagram and tik tok vids of them reacting to the bar, seemingly in agreement with Kendrick.

However, the first person to actually fire back wasn‚Äôt Drake, but J.Cole funny enough in a, quite weak diss track aim at Kendrick. With it being quite clear that he didn‚Äôt want to really do so, and only did so under peer pressure. In fact bot long after, at a show, J.Cole apologized for doing so, admitting that not only was it a bad move and a bad song, but it was also out of character for him to do so. While he was clowned by many at the time for this action, those who did admit in hindsight he was right to do so.

Not long, Drake would finally drop his diss record, Push Ups, a decent, but not super deep track aimed at Kendrick. The track was overall kinda of juvenile one, with the most mean spirited thing being the hit at Kendricks Height, as Kung Fu Kenny is admittedly a short king. But it wasn‚Äôt a bad track, and many took as a decent warning shot at Kendrick, if not a juvenile one.

Weeks pasted, and many wondered what would Kennys response be. And low and behold we got it in the form of euphoria, a brutal and scathing track that, like it‚Äôs spiritual predecessor in the track The Story Of Addion, a particularly infamous  diss at Drake by the Rapper Pusha T, was a layered diss that broke Drake in so many ways.

Not only was it a condemnation of Drakes character in terms of how fake he his, with his constant thieving of other styles, rhyme flows and even ACCENTS, his seeming uncaring attitude to many current Black issues, and of course his previous known role of being an absent father, but also it made it quite clear that while Kendrick is in good terms with the rest of the Hip Hop community, he HATES Drake. This is despite their many collaborations in the past, Kendrick seems to legitimately not like him, if not out right hate him.

The Track was a brutal one, and not after people waited quite eagerly for drakes response, since Kendricks was SO brutal. And recently Drake did so with the track FAMILY MATTERS, which was a nasty track that heavily implied that Kendrick was a wife beater. But just before that Kendrick another one called 6:16 to June, another brutal track, and literally the next 30 minutes after FAMILY MATTERS dropped Kendrick dropped another in the chamber called Meet The Ghrames, Which has been particularly scathing.

Beef is still ongoing.

And the more I think on it, the more and more I realize that the majority of the ""best beefs/mutual hatreds"" are actually one-sided affairs between that world's largest hater, and the guy or gal they are hating on. 

And while that is worthy of a thread itself, one as fiery as the hatred of the greatest of haters, this is for the more mutual affairs. 

Where though one side of the equation can clearly be more of a hater then the other, both sides clearly hate one another with a passion. 

**-][-**

So in my case I am going to go with some Pathfinder Lore. 

Long long ago, in the distant past, Lamashtu the Demon Queen rose from the Abyss to become a *god*. The Queen of Monsters had many children, and many consorts, but she took one soul and crafted it above all others. 

Once born the first Minotaur in existence, hailing from the isle of Ibyldos, Baphomet was blessed by Lamashtu with many curses in life, and in death she captured his soul and did the same. 

Though her favored consort, Baphomet found himself at the bottom of her divine court, below even her children and former lovers, and so devised a plan. He plotted, planned, and schemed his way to the top of her court, but even then found himself wanting and schemed for a way to make himself Lamashtu's equal.

Baphomet schemed to steal the Ruby-Rod of Asomedus, the Archstar,  from Hell itself, and so enacted a plan to raid the Hells and capture the antediluvian artifact. 

He failed, and when Lamashtu denied all relation with him, Asmoedus turned towards the greatest of all Minotaurs and enacted his punishment. 

As a sign of his displeasure at Baphomet's arrogant raid, the Dark Prince of the Hells carved his own divine symbol into the lowly Demonic Minotaur's skull using the point of his nail of his index finger, and banished him into a prison of his own making. 

The Ivory Labyrinth. 

Pleased with his work the Dark Prince declared the maze unsolvable, and threw Baphomet into the prison of a maze to wander forever lost and forever to act as the pet of Asmodeus. 

But this was where Asmodeus made a mistep, for Baphomet was ever cunning and in short order, found in his decade of wandering a truth of the prison. 

His imprisonment had changed [Baphomet](https://pathfinder.fandom.com/wiki/Baphomet?file=Baphomet_%28Paizo_Publishing%29.jpg), gone was the cunning hulking brute, and what remained was a emaciated scheming plotter, one capable of patience rivaling the gods themselves. 

He *stole* his Divinely made prison, and made it his own seat of power and might. 

The Ivory Labyrinth gave birth to a Demon LORD, and with this theft Asmodeus has been slighted in such a way that none have ever replicated the feat before or after. 

 Even now the the two beings hate on one another. 

Asmoedeus seethes at the slight and views Baphomet as a nuscience he will have to personally take care of for daring to outsmart him. 

Baphomet even now plans a return to the hells, building his armies and schemes and treacheries once more, not to steal from the Hells as might be supposed, but to bring the Dark Prince to his knees and repay the favor. He will carve his own symbol into the Dark Prince, just as was done to him, and then devour his divine soul.

This is unlikely to be anyone else's favorite beef/mutual hatred in Pathfinder, let alone most fiction, but I find it to be really memorable to me.

I can totally see Drake pulling a Meek Mill here. They have the same fruity demeanor and maybe he shot his shot with Kendrick but Kendrick denied it. I think Kendrick's upcoming response will shed more light on their possible relationship.

I've seen countless Gen Xers who virtually ""check out"" of Hip-hop since the 2000s, giving commentary and praising this ongoing ""beef.""

It feels as though it has sparked interest in contemporary hip-hop for Gen X in a way that I haven't seen before.

So to see Gen X not actually complain about the state of hip hop but praise this particularly feud, alongside the younger generation of Milennials and Gen Z is quite refreshing.

Am I qualified? Who knows. But opinions are like assholes.

So here we go.

Kendrick won.

He‚Äôs managed to cast Drake as a tone-deaf reactionary.

I mean it isn‚Äôt hard to see that.

‚ÄúTaylor made Freestyle‚Äù was already not a great look for Drake.

But then we got ‚ÄúMeet the Grahams‚Äù and ‚ÄúNot like us‚Äù. Which are pretty much Drake‚Äôs murder and burial at this point. It was brutal enough that Drake is no longer in a position to attack. He has to defend. And his defenses are doing him no favors.

‚ÄúThe Heart Part 6‚Äù actually actively makes Drake look worse.

Drake‚Äôs defenses can best be summed up as: 

1.) ‚ÄúMy friends gaslit you into thinking I have secret daughter. Hahaha.‚Äù

2.) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a pedo. I‚Äôm too rich and famous.‚Äù

3.) ‚ÄúYou were sexually assaulted. That‚Äôs why you hate pedos.‚Äù

4.) ‚ÄúYou hit your Fianc√©e.‚Äù

5.) ‚ÄúYour kid‚Äôs aren‚Äôt yours.‚Äù

Which, I mean what?

1.) ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm a master manipulator? Jokes on you; I am a master manipulator‚Ä¶oh wait.‚Äù

2.) That isn‚Äôt the defense you think it is homey. Especially not in the current social climate around kids in show buisness. (Ala: Quiet on Set.) You were a child-actor you should know this or should be more self-aware. The fact you aren‚Äôt makes you look tone deaf.

3.) The fact he attacks a sexual assault victim for being victimized is gross in-and-of itself. But the cherry on top is that his lyrics come off as a defense of predators. Doesn‚Äôt everyone hate pedos? Again, it makes him look tone deaf and empathy-deprived.

4.) The burden of proof is on you for this one homeboy. You bring receipts on that?

5.) Same as above only it makes him seem tone deaf as he‚Äôs basically criticizing Kendrick for taking care of a child.

Not only did he drop a video responding to ‚ÄúEuphoria‚Äù with subtle yet creative references, but also dropped little hints here and there about planting false information for Kendrick and predicted/assumed how Kendrick would respond or had a song already done to respond with the false information leading to ‚ÄúMeet the Grahams‚Äù. Then Kendrick dropped ‚ÄúNot Like Us‚Äù the following day to cover up the mistake of falling for the trap Drake set him up for. Kendrick no longer even talks about the supposed Daughter he thought existed and removed the album artwork he thought was Drakes contents.

First, he uses an AI voice models of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg. Now Pac and Snoop are two of the most iconic rappers of the west coast.

He even dedicated an entire song to him on TPAB (Mortal Man). Snoop has proclaimed that Kendrick was the present-day King of the west coast and even participated a concert with Dre, Cube, Game and Kendrick where they handed the torch to Kendrick. In their AI verses, they‚Äôre begging Kendrick to respond to Drake to represent his coast and for hip hop in general. Drake even included some self-deprecating humor in the verse to like Pac saying ‚Äúfuck this Canadian light-skinned nigga‚Äù. Basically Pac and Snoop are saying what hip hop fans are thinking rn.

Drake pulls an 8 Mile in this diss where in the Pac AI verse, Pac tells Kendrick to talk about Drake and his allegations and rumors of texting teen girls.

14.The Tiny Potshot Tracks (Various Artists) - Future, Weeknd, Rocky, etc. all did zero damage to Drake with any of their verses and it looked corny as shit for them to try and get involved. Literally provide nothing to the beef but hurting their own side. Butt out.

Final Grade: NO GRADE

13.Seven Minute Drill - What hasn‚Äôt been said about this track already?  I didn‚Äôt like it when it came out but I like it even less after the apology. J. Cole starts off with a mediocre beat and goes on to throw warning shots that essentially amount to ‚ÄòI think TPAB is overrated and ‚ÄòKendrick doesn‚Äôt really drop very often‚Äô. I get that he was trying to frame it as him checking Kendrick and throwing warning shots, but this beef had been presented as mostly warning shots and every other warning track was better. This was the equivalent of being pushed, trying to swing back and tripping over your own feet before apologizing for even trying. I agree when Cole called it the lamest shit he ever did. While in hindsight his apology was smart, I think we would have all preferred he never released this track in the first place. Still tuned in for the Fall Off tho.

Final Grade: D-

12. Like That (Kanye Remix) - This track was ass. Kanye being a self important loser and inserting himself into the beef to do nothing but go ‚ÄòLook at Me!‚Äô while saying nothing of substance is trash but it was pretty expected from me at least. He doesn‚Äôt even have a Drake line in the entire song other than saying that HE DOESN‚ÄôT HAVE A DRAKE LINE! (And the Lucian bar) Maybe I‚Äôm just colored by everything that happened after Seven Minute Drill, but I rank this slightly higher just because that one shitty throwaway line about Cole music drying up pussies is funnier than anything on 7MD, and the fact that the beat was honestly amazing. Some of Metro‚Äôs best work. 

Final Grade: D


11.The Heart Part 6 - This might end up my longest review of the list by far because it has a lot to unpack. I‚Äôm going to be honest, this song does have some genuine positives that unburdened by their flaws would likely see it around a high B or a low A. Drake for one sticks to his guns and doubles down on the Dave Free shit which (aside from the negatives I‚Äôll talk about later) is a smart move since it puts the accusations regarding Whitney back in the mix and him pressing Kendrick for proof makes him look more credible by comparison. He also has some pretty nice bars in there like the whole ‚ÄúWhitney when I hit you back it‚Äôll be a lot safer‚Äù and the A minor B sharp scheme as a response to Not Like Us. He also demonstrates that he‚Äôs willing to go even lower than he‚Äôd demonstrated in prior raps by making Kendrick‚Äôs ‚Äúmolestation‚Äù the punchline of a series of bars. I‚Äôm personally more impressed by his malice than disapproving. They‚Äôd both crossed the line a while back and willing to go dark is a positive IMO. But now comes the laundry list of issues with this record. They can be broken down into two major sections: 1. CREDIBILITY: Throughout the feud, a lot of very serious accusations have been made on both sides and most of them don‚Äôt seem to have much if any proof behind them. Proof may or may not come out in good time but until then they exist in a weird flux state of being not firmly true nor false. After all there‚Äôs no way to truly disprove the more serious accusations regarding pedophilia and domestic violence. The problem here is that Drake makes a laundry list of claims on this record that aren‚Äôt just unsubstantiated but noticeably shaky or even able to be debunked via publicly available information. The fake mole would make him look like an idiot if true because he let Kendrick overshadow Family Matters and if he‚Äôd simply provided the receipts after Meet the Grahams or just the DMs he would have likely won the beef right then and there. He waited days and let videos and posts with tens of millions of views circulate calling him a pedophile when he could have avoided it all. Also the song he mentioned on Mr. Morale has Kendrick state plainly that he WASN‚ÄôT molested so that angle falls flat. Finally saying that being very rich or famous means you can‚Äôt be a pedo is funny considering almost every well known serial sex pest is one or both. 2. CONCEDING: Drake essentially says he‚Äôs done with the beef during this song and also doesn‚Äôt bring a lot of energy. It‚Äôs a big shift from the days of Push Ups and Taylor Made where he was begging Kendrick to drop and baiting him constantly over social media. It doesn‚Äôt look like he‚Äôs the bigger person, it makes him look exhausted and worn out. He was already in a position where most of the internet was saying he‚Äôd been destroyed so it doesn‚Äôt come across as him bowing out. Him taking a vacation could not have been timed worse. In conclusion a song with a lot of promised that‚Äôs the most flawed on the list.

Final Grade: D+

10.6:16 in LA - Same concept as Taylor Made Freestyle. A needling track made purely to antagonize Drake into making a response. I liked the beat on this but the first half is pretty filler filled and the jabs about Drake‚Äôs camp while strong are not too biting or even shocking considering how large Drake‚Äôs crew is. Not much to say here. Also whoever told Kendrick to sing here should feel bad about their decision making skills.

Final Grade: C

9.Taylor Made Freestyle - I‚Äôm not going to be one of those losers pretending this isn‚Äôt hard because it used AI. Nah this isn‚Äôt very hard because it doesn‚Äôt really do much. I get why of course. It‚Äôs a bait track to try and coax a response from Kendrick. The use of AI is certainly disrespectful and the angle is interesting but it doesn‚Äôt really say anything outrageous or even all that disrespectful towards Kendrick himself. It‚Äôs not a total abomination, but it falls noticeably flat compared to the dedicated disses and even compared to some of the one verse attacks that we‚Äôll get into later.  It gets the edge over 6:16 in LA for how much it pissed off Kendrick. 

Final Grade: C+

8.Like That - Might be a little low for some people but we‚Äôre judging these as diss tracks more than as records (though there definitely is a bit of that involved too hence why this is even at five). As a pure song, this is easily top three and maybe even top 1 on the list. But the disses only come from Kendrick‚Äôs verse and Cole catches essentially nothing. The big 3/big me moment will be iconic for years to come and there were two pretty hard bars towards Drake with the Pet Cemetery line and the Prince Outlived Mike Jack. It also gets huge props for being the track that kicked off the official Drake Kendrick beef. But there‚Äôs one track that really kicked off the 2024 diss trend that nobody here wants to talk about‚Ä¶

Final Grade: B-

7.HISS - For whatever reason people don‚Äôt want to give Meg her credit here considering she released the first major diss of the year. She really gets in her bag here and comes out with so many different shots at so many different people. I think some people completely forget that she actually dedicated more bars to Drake here than she ever did Nicki. She actually brought up the whole surgery shit before anyone else and even gave the blue print for the higher ranked Euphoria‚Äôs ‚ÄòDrake‚Äôs an accent faking bad bitch‚Äô angle. I can‚Äôt rank the track any higher in this specific list since it only comes at any of the beef participants for like four bars but this track is really underrated and managed to hit a lot of people decently hard. 

Final Grade: B-

6.Champagne Moments - There are definitely people that are going to put this lower in their lists but personally I loved it. It‚Äôs not nearly as far behind the next two spots for me as it might be for some other people. I‚Äôve never been the biggest Ross fan but the way he raps over this luxurious beat makes it feel like he‚Äôs beating Drake‚Äôs ass in a five star hotel. He definitely did focus a little too heavily on Drake‚Äôs race, but honestly it was super funny hearing the repeated ‚Äúwhite boy‚Äôs‚Äù on the track. And while the track itself was ok, that outro was genuinely amazing and one of the most hilarious things I‚Äôve heard in a long time. Plus there genuinely were some hard lines on the actual track. 

Final Grade: B


5.Push Ups - Now THIS, this right here is how you respond to a diss track. Drake managed to shut down every single jab on Like That in masterful fashion before going on to expose Kendrick being allegedly extorted by his label, and clown him for being a midget. All the while he managed to throw shots at Future, Weeknd, freaking Jah Morant and most notably Metro over a song that is going to get played in the club with a fun refrain. Loved the energy here from Drake. My only criticisms of the track are ones he couldn‚Äôt exactly control for.  Those being that he whule he neutralized a lot of Kendrick‚Äôs stuff he didn‚Äôt actually add much besides the extortion stuff with Top (which rings pretty hollow coming from Drake). I mean Drake didn‚Äôt really have time with how many people he had to address after all and the lines about his height were still pretty funny. Still a great diss track considering what he had to do during, but as you can probably tell by the spot I gave it, it wasn‚Äôt the best either artist could offer. 

Final Grade: B+

4.Euphoria - Let me get the criticism out of the way first. Kendrick didn‚Äôt really say anything insane before the Melly line and the track covers publicly discussed topics. But holy crap this was a strong track. Everything from that Melly bar onwards was nasty. I don‚Äôt think I went four bars without a strong reaction from then on. Every topic that had been talked about previously was perfected by Kendrick here. From the way he tackled his identity issues to him being a snake he managed to phrase everything in a variety of vicious ways. Hell he even managed to flip the fact that he said nothing new into a body blow about Drake as a father.  I also feel like the replay value critique is overblown if not altogether false. While I‚Äôm not going to be bumping this as much as a Like That or a HISS or even a Push Ups, there are definitely a good amount of pretty nice quotables and that second beat is super fun. (And about a week later it‚Äôs still top 2 on Apple Music and Spotify so it‚Äôs definitely got replay value).  Plus for me I‚Äôve been catching more bars on follow up listens to the point that I like it a lot more on my last listen then I did on my first. It‚Äôs also in retrospect a very accurate prediction of how Drake was going to try and play the rest of their beef from there. 

Final Grade: A-

3.Family Matters - This track was amazing. This was essentially Push Ups but better in every facet. We start off with the best from the end of Push Ups and Drake gets to singing which I don‚Äôt like very much, but he is a self proclaimed singing nigga so it makes sense. He hits Kendrick from some NASTY angles. He portrays Kendrick as an insecure, colorist, midget, cuck. He also makes the very serious accusation of Kendrick being an abusive fianc√© and trying to drive he and his family apart. Had me looking side eyed at Dave Free myself (Or should I say Dave Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee). All of this over three fire ass beats with a pretty nice music video. Drake said this was his red button and as far as red buttons go, this was a very strong one. It‚Äôs only even this low because there are a few stand out problems with the record. First, the whole thing about him being ashamed to be seen with Enoch thing seems odd considering Kendrick just generally doesn‚Äôt get photographed a lot in public and the fact that he was on the cover of MMATBS. Also Enoch and Adonis being the same shade is pretty disingenuous to anyone with eyes. Another issue is actually the same thing I praised Push Ups for a little, and that‚Äôs addressing a bunch of other people during the track instead of going straight at Kendrick. Because here it feels forced and more like an excuse to seem like he‚Äôs being jumped by the industry. While his responses here are solid, most of these people took shots at him before Push Ups and other than Ross haven‚Äôt said anything since. I still rate this higher than Euphoria because instead of having a good minute and a half of mid, this had about two minutes of strong but misdirected content. 

Final Grade: A-

2.Not Like Us - Usually I‚Äôm not big on a song being a banger as a plus, but here it really is what makes Not Like Us rank so highly. Because it firstly thoroughly dispels a major criticism throughout the entire beef being that Kendrick‚Äôs songs have less replayability than Drake‚Äôs. And secondly, because unlike every track other than Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50, Metro Shut Your Hoe Ass Up and Make Some Drums Nigga) and to a lesser extent Euphoria (We Don‚Äôt Wanna Hear You Say Nigga No Mooooooorrrrreeee), the quotables and refrains are all disses directed towards Drake. And there are more of them than any other song on this list. (Freaky Ass Nigga he the 69 God, Say OV-HOE, Say Drake‚Ä¶.I hear you like them young, A Minoooooorrrrrrr etc.) It already has seen play during an MLB game and during the NBA playoffs as of recent. It‚Äôs the biggest hip hop debut in Spotify history as well. Super catchy and unlike Push Ups or Like That, it‚Äôs very focused on one person and hitting them with the most damaging accusation you can. Even better, this song is hilarious throughout while also containing a really good verse reframing Drake‚Äôs relationship with Atlanta rappers. It manages to both be a really good diss and arguably the best pure song on this list. 

Final Grade: A

1.Meet the Grahams - Genuinely what the fuck. This might be the most vile, malicious, damaging track I‚Äôve ever heard. Now obviously the validity of the claims in the track is very much up in the air. I definitely have my doubts regarding lil miss Adonia being real at the very least. But honestly just taking the first and last verses alone would have me put this at number one. Kendrick is evil as shit for making this but it‚Äôs a piece of art. It was a systematic character assassination that for a lot of people ended the beef. This will never be played in a club. It probably won‚Äôt be played by anyone more than once in most cases. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, dark, and menacing in a way the lower ranked THE HEART PART 6 attempts to be but fails at. He talks about Drake‚Äôs (alleged) drug addiction, sex addiction, gambling addiction, poor parenting, insecurities regarding his body, insecurities regarding his culture and masculinity, inauthenticity, insecurities regarding his parents etc. without even getting into the pedophilia/fake child stuff. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever get a track this cruel and poignant for a very long time. This is a classic. 

Final Grade: A+

Kendrick fans yall might hate this but keep in mind I was a fan of his music up until last week, still am just dont mess with him at all.

So obviously this started a while ago but just off these past few weeks who do you guys believe has won?

I have Kendrick winning in Bars but thats all. When this first started I told my brother whoever gets who out of character is the winner. Drake since 2016 has had these allegations so we wouldve needed a heavy hit.  Kendrick on the other hand doesnt really have a blemish on his record and we finally got to see under the mask, and im very disappointed as to what I saw.

I have Drake winning the war based off strictly rebuttals and doing exactly what I thought drake would do.

Kendrick is deemed the Voice of the Black Community, and Black Activist and a Leader and a Street guy. All of these have a standard, as a community we cant toss these words around lightly. Listening to his music and not really caring enough o do research on him he it the mold. But after throwing his stones and doing my research on Drake I also have to do research on him. Did you know that Kendricks biggest donations to the community have been toy drives, rallying for prostitution and women's rights, donating to schools in Compton(a suburb) and of course taking a class to his grammy ceremony. Safe to say all of these are PR stunts since they are around the time of release of the music he so barely drops. Why is this important? I learned he wasnt that guy! Someone that has his position or those titles of the community would be the most powerful black activist we have seen to date. His platform reaches millions in seconds. He has yet to build tech or coding schools or programs in Compton let a lone our community as a whole. Hasn't bought farm land to give job opportunities but also emulate the asians and grow and sell our own products to black business with better quality and cheaper rates. Heck he isnt even using his platform to have artist go to these churches and bring in money that can be donated to the communities that they are in. But he is showing up to those Black Lives Matter LGBTQ meetings. 

Let's get deeper on the damage this has done to the community. From this same black activist he carried the energy of ""white boy"" into battle against a black man in a mixed world. Funny for the beef so we can argue intent but results are damaging. Please realize majority of the points in this battle have been due to stereotypical issues and historical issues that have decimated our community for generations. We have people laughing at our community once again seeing all of the race jokes, all of the gay jokes, all the light skinned jokes and talking about a mans features or being a dead beat. Drake is very much Black one could argue he has more ties to the community then Kendrick. Here's why! After doing all that research I learned Drakes dad comes from the cloth of making music with Al green and other well known names in the 70s. Let's go back to that era, the black panthers were established late 66 early 67 this is when Funk, Soul, Jazz, Rock were pivotal pieces within the black movements. These branches of music became some of the sparks within our revolution and being from Memphis during the era was wild. Let alone a black man getting a jewish Canadian women, his pops had to be one of them guys. Drake was literally born into this so to say hes not a part of the culture and you're this righteous black man just doesnt sit right. Especially when everyone talking are the people he put on. Do yall realize kendrick said ""I wouldve kept these secrets""? Alluding to I only speak out on issues when its beneficial for me otherwise Im behind the seems cooling. Which is why hes making songs with Taylor swift and the same industry he supposedly speaking against. Ironically enough 2pac came up. Yall know Kendrick is under Interscope the same people that left Pac and his family out to dry, so burnt they sold that mans rights to a white boy in Eminem who kendrick again run under. How can that be your ""idol"" then? Kendrick again a walking contradiction.  

Since we are on history let's take this from an historical standpoint. These Light skinned people everyone is saying cant say the N word right now, well those are majority of the black activist that got us here. Why? Because these people were allowed different education so they actually had to work the system and educational field to put all of us as a community into a better position.¬†Thats why you see a lot of our black leaders and early educators Light Skinned and mixed. This isnt something to joke on especially if yall are saying we are the ""voice"" or ""culture"" when we obviously lack education and hes proving it. 

But it all made sense on that Meet the Grahams. We just hyped a grown man starting a song off saying ""dear adonis"" then proceeded to lecture an 11 year old about how to be a man. This is wild because there is no guy on earth playing in the streets that would even think to do something like this. Especially a man that doesnt even have his own home fixed. Again a contradiction and coming out of character. Which leads in to him harping on the black experience. Universally in any black culture since when do we throw out allegations without proof? This gets you killed where we from. So as a street guy or someone who is taking someones black card you not even cut from he same cloth, he just as lame and ""white"" as Drake. So we cant hype colonizer when you obviously have the mindset and hip hop is all inclusive. I bet none of the people right now can name me the 5 elements of hip hop lol. Since when do Stand up Men in this guy position get on songs and talk to someone mom and tell her your son should die. This not the culture thats feminine white boy shit. Let's call it what it is, if one of the guys said that we would just look at him smh. 

  
Then I heard heart part 6, weird song but it wasnt the song that made me call kendrick for what it is. Kendrick is supposedly this high intellectual, patient and calculated, original, a leader. How you get bad info? One would have to assume you were so desperate to push this beef or agenda for attention. Drake showed us hes the same guy all of them are. Which is why he ran off rick ross energy with he white boy. Same rick ross who drops drugs in women's drink when they dont know it. Again broke Kendricks character out played him, kendrick was so gullible he believed the same story pusha t did, ran to blogs from 2016 and attacked race. Thats not the signs of intelligence or an educated man its the signs of someone enjoying the fame just like all them do. Clout and attention and money and feeding the same jewish people drake messing with while causing division. 

Now let's get into Music:

Kendrick killed him with bars. Like not even close just hitting this man with combos. 

Best song Not like Us just the whole flow is nasty business. Euphoria is up there as well but Not Like Us probably undervalued. Even tho its lies im just speaking on the song. Thats the kendrick I expected, when he goes into his bag. I cant give drake a win on this, K Dot just forever lyrically better. We wouldve needed to see J Cole and Kendrick to really see who's the best lyrical monster. 

  
Drakes song just bops. I cant even be mad at it. That last shit was decent some crazy lil bars. But his first line up is just drake. Once he went on that chicago beat(and I am bias im from the city) he be talking that talk. But nobody can really put a song together better than Drake. Thats just what it is and why they hate him, he can do any flow ghost writer or not hes given us generational talents time and time again. Have to respect it. 

  
All in All great battle got to hear some crazy bars and schemes I never even thought about. Real life bars and shit you had to research. This was like a class and they were handing out textbooks to their listeners. Everyone doing homework waking up ready lol. Ive been around since 90 seen a lot of rap beefs. This might have been the most entertaining. 

  
Kendrick won every battle but lost the war.

If it wasn't, like, 12 years old, I'd believe that it was manufactured by the industry to boost interest & sales. Does anyone even know what started it!?? Did some research, listened to the songs, & apparently it started after Kendrick dissed Drake (& a bunch of other rapers) in, like, 2013!? After he went on tour with him before!? So that makes him just like his idol 2Pac -- a good artist, but MESSY. Then there's the benign ""Big 3"" reference by J Cole, which Kendrick also responded to with something relatively benign. So, that's it? That's what started it!? That shit is weak. At least the Pac & Big feud was because Tupac (wrongly) thought Biggie & Puffy tried to have him **k--led** -- that's a logical reason to go to war. Now, I just feel like every rapper wants to emulate the 2Pac & Biggie beef, so they can be legendary on that level. Every rapper wanna be like 2Pac & Biggie -- until they end up **just like** 2Pac & Biggie.

Look, I have no favorite in this match (I think they're both two of the greatest rappers), but who am I supposed to root for? This is just a battle of egos. Two rappers calling each other narcissists is like two mental patients calling each other crazy; or that meme of two Spider-mans pointing at each other. Best case scenario: they're both lying about each other, which makes them both trash. Worst case scenario: they're both telling the truth, which means one is a woman beater & the other is a p\*dophile -- so who the fuck am I supposed to root for?

Kendrick is clearly the fan favorite, but -- like him or not -- Drake has managed to hold his own easily. I don't know why people are acting like he's getting ate up. Despite the ghostwriting allegations (which I take very seriously as a writer myself), he CLEARLY has nasty bars & can write his own rhymes on Kendrick's level. At the end of this (which seems never-ending, & I'm already bored with it), all they've done is made each other look bad. The power to make music is such a beautiful talent.

I know social media is at best a hivemind of a minority of polarizing opinions but I‚Äôm shocked Family Matters isn‚Äôt getting more love. I have it as a better diss track than Meet The Grahams by a decent bit.

So far, on Kendrick‚Äôs verses, I‚Äôve got Euphoria > Meet the Grahams. Like that is close just for the publicity it got but it was a good intro verse. For Drake, I thought Push ups was a good intro, Taylor Made Freestyle was creative and had some good bars but not cutthroat, but Family Matters was cold and my top track of this saga. Euphoria a really close second.

Back to Meet The Grahams - good song and, just like drakes accusations, it needs concrete receipts. And if what he's saying is true, it's fucked up he held on to this instead of going to the feds?? Drakes accusations were basically dave free (IIRC kendricks manager, right?) was piping his wife down and one of those kids is his, and we heard you was beating her. The only one he could do something with is the last one, and it seems like that was already handled legally. To be clear, if Kendrick's accusations are true, then I genuinely hope he has receipts so Drake can be put behind bars.

Putting aside accusations from both sides and getting back to the music, the rest of Meet The Grahams was basically ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt approve of the way you drink, the drugs you‚Äôre on, I‚Äôm a better father than you, and you maybe have more kids we don‚Äôt know about‚Äù which I admit doesn't really do shit for me? And I agree w/ Kendrick. I'm sure he's a better human than Drake but in a rap beef that doesn't do anything for me. I could've bet and won money that Kendrick lives a more wholesome life than Drake way before Like That came out.

Anyway, I'm curious what anyone else who isn't a meat rider of either artist thinks. I know Drake is easy to hate on and the Kendrick dickriders are out in full effect (seriously, Kdot could say ""the sky is blue"" and some of these boys would be like ""damn, he's so intellectual. the modern day socrates frfr"")

I have Euphoria and Family Matters as the top two tracks of the saga so far. Like that and Meet The Grahams after, Push Ups and Taylor Made Freestyle, and lastly 6:16 in LA.

That is something Drake simply can't and didn't do when given similar tools. 

Drake essentially to me put on a 2pac and snoop costume to big himself up and continue to make the same  shallow and self centered music that's makes up a majority of his catalog.

I never was a Drake fan, cant recall a single track. Massive Jcole and Kdot fan. But‚Ä¶
 In my opinion Drake won this beef - the fact that he played chess - fed Kdot false info - and Kdot like an idiot made a whole track about it. Totally fooled and out done.
 I find it weird NO ONE talks about that or mentions it.
The fact that Kdot didnt fact check just makes everything else he says bs too. No ones talking about that instead saying that Meet the grahams was such a good track.

I also find it weird that EVERYONE is focused on allegations against Drake that hes a pedo (like SO many famous people) 
but NO ONE is talking about allegations against Kdot? No ones talking about the wife beating - the Dave free affair allegations. Very weird.

People saying Drakes angles are weak?
 But kdots angle is that hes not black enough? How racist is that? Just going at skin color.
Pedo allegations and being a bad dad?
Show me a famous rapper or celeb that isnt a bad dad, with baby mommas and illegitimate kids.
Kdot is supposed to be mr morale but doesnt live with his kids? Drake shoes off his kids more than Kendrick.

I respect dot, I respect his talent, I respect his discography, but a lot of so called ‚Äòhip hop heads‚Äô have this messiah complex when it comes to him, and I personally think its the biggest problem in hip hop rn. 

In 2024, and the culture is still filled with elitist takes. Sure there are artist that are undeniably superior to others, but as a lifelong fan of the culture we‚Äôve seen this time and time again. When the west coast started coming up New Yorkers said it wasn‚Äôt hip hop, when the south started coming up, the same sentiments were echoed. 

Its so bad that even last year during the 50th anniversary of hip hop MC Hammer, a whole legend, did not attend any ceremonies because he was ostracized during his career for his fun approach to hip hop. Even Will Smith is hardly recognized as a pioneer/real MC. 

So to me this beef is a culmination of the ‚Äòreal rap‚Äô and ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô camps being at odds for years, when they‚Äôre two sides of the same coin. Ironic, but hell what isn‚Äôt these days? 

And I see a lot people making excuses for kendrick, saying things like his silence is a tactic, he don‚Äôt play internet games, some going as far to say that he doesn‚Äôt really have to respond since he‚Äôs superior, and the cognitive dissonance of it all is palpable at this point. 

Public engagement and reaction is everything when it comes to a battle, you‚Äôre not graded on your discography or popularity. Its track for track, and right now drake is up 2-0, because drake has dropped two tracks and kendrick has yet to respond, and the idea that Drake could win is looking more like a reality and the aftermath if it happens will restart a much needed conversation.

‚ÄúExtortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch‚Äù

TLDR at bottom

Seems like somewhat of a throwaway line, right? Obviously Kendrick had a line earlier about having a direct flight, so maybe it is just a common ‚Äúmy middle name is danger‚Äù sorta bar + a slight reference to an earlier Kendrick bar. 

But it ain‚Äôt. 

Second time I listened to this song, about 12 hours ago now, I was confused by this line. Why would Kendrick say this? Tf does this even mean? So I googled ‚Äúextortion plane‚Äù. Which brought me to a Wikipedia article about a Chinook Helicopter that got shot down in Afghanistan in 2011 by an RPG. The helicopter‚Äôs callsign was Extortion 17. 

‚ÄúLmao helicopters ain‚Äôt planes lol kdot fans reaching‚Äù Yeah no shit, and Kendrick is short, we know. 

Anyway a helicopter called Extortion-17 got shot down. The ‚Äúas soon as you jump out of that plane‚Äù is a reference to what the helicopter was trying to pick up: US Navy Seals and US Army Rangers. 

The obvious connection for me here is that Army Rangers are notorious for being paratroopers, *jumping out of planes*, but Navy Seals are also trained to do so. 

**Kendrick is making a reference to the Rangers and SEALs that died from extortion-17 being shot down.**

Beyond that, some of the SEALs that died were part of SEAL team 6. The helicopter Extortion literally killed part of the Six. I don‚Äôt think I need to explain that one even to the Drake fans reading this. 

Other relevance to this: Extortion-17 is an obvious reference to Drake‚Äôs underaged allegations; particularly him groping the 17 year old on stage and making remarks about her even after he knew her age. And one last thing; Today is 17 days since ‚ÄúPush-Ups‚Äù dropped and Drake threatened to extort Kendrick.

This line is single-handedly the most clever and well-hidden 

It could be a reach. It could be a coincidence. I could be a meat rider. 

But there‚Äôs too much there for it to just be a coincidence from Kendrick, if ya ask me. 

TLDR: Helicopter called Extortion 17 got shot down killing people that dropped from a plane and were part of SEAL team 6. ‚ÄúExtortion 17‚Äù is an obvious threat about having Drake hooking up with a 17 year old.

Here‚Äôs how I have it from worst to best:

9. The Tiny Potshot Tracks (Various Artists) - Future, Weeknd, Rocky, etc. all did zero damage to Drake with any of their verses and it looked corny as shit for them to try and get involved. Literally provide nothing to the beef but hurting their own side. Butt out.

NO GRADE

8. Seven Minute Drill - What hasn‚Äôt been said about this track already?  I didn‚Äôt like it when it came out but I like it even less after the apology. J. Cole starts off with a mediocre beat and goes on to throw warning shots that essentially amount to ‚ÄòI think TPAB is overrated and ‚ÄòKendrick doesn‚Äôt really drop very often‚Äô. I get that he was trying to frame it as him checking Kendrick and throwing warning shots, but this beef has been presented as mostly warning shots and every other track has been better. This was the equivalent of being pushed, trying to swing back and tripping over your own feet before apologizing for even trying. I agree when Cole called it the lamest shit he ever did. Still tuned in for the Fall Off tho.

Final Grade: D-

7. Like That (Kanye Remix) - This track was ass. Kanye being a self important loser and inserting himself into the beef to do nothing but go ‚ÄòLook at Me!‚Äô while saying nothing of substance is trash but it was pretty expected from me at least. He doesn‚Äôt even have a Drake line in the entire song other than saying that HE DOESN‚ÄôT HAVE A DRAKE LINE! Maybe I‚Äôm just colored by everything that happened after Seven Minute Drill, but I rank this slightly higher just because that one shitty throwaway line about Cole music drying up pussies is funnier than anything on 7MD, and the fact that the beat was honestly amazing. Some of Metro‚Äôs best work. 

Final Grade: D

6. Taylor Made Freestyle - I‚Äôm not going to be one of those losers pretending this isn‚Äôt hard because it used AI. Nah this isn‚Äôt very hard because it doesn‚Äôt really do much. I get why of course. It‚Äôs a bait track to try and coax a response from Kendrick. The use of AI is certainly disrespectful and the angle is interesting but it doesn‚Äôt really say anything outrageous or even all that wildly disrespectful towards Kendrick himself. It‚Äôs not a total abomination, but it falls noticeably flat compared to the dedicated disses and even compared to some of the one verse attacks that we‚Äôll get into later.

Final Grade: C+

5. Like That - Might be a little low for some people but we‚Äôre judging these as diss tracks more than as records (though there definitely is a bit of that involved too hence why this is even at five). As a pure song, this is easily top three and probably top 1 on the list. But the disses only come from Kendrick‚Äôs verse and Cole catches essentially nothing. The big 3/big me moment will be iconic for years to come and there were two pretty hard bars towards Drake with the Pet Cemetery line and the Prince Outlived Mike Jack. It also gets huge props for being the track that kicked off the official Drake Kendrick beef. But there‚Äôs one track that really kicked off the 2024 diss trend that nobody here wants to talk about‚Ä¶

Final Grade: B-

4. HISS - For whatever reason people don‚Äôt want to give Meg her credit here considering she released the first major diss of the year. She really gets in her bag here and comes out with so many different shots at so many different people. I think some people completely forget that she actually dedicated more bars to Drake here than she ever did Nicki. She actually brought up the whole surgery shit before anyone else and even gave the blue print for the higher ranked Euphoria‚Äôs Drake‚Äôs and accent faking bad bitch angle. I can‚Äôt rank the track any higher in this specific list since it only comes at any of the beef participants for like four bars but but this track is really underrated and managed to hit a lot of people decently hard. 

Final Grade: B

3. Champagne Moments - There are definitely people that are going to put this lower in their lists but personally I loved it. It‚Äôs not nearly as far behind the next two spots for me as it might be for some other people. I‚Äôve never been the biggest Ross fan but the way he raps over this luxurious ass beat makes it feel like he‚Äôs beating Drake‚Äôs ass in a five star hotel. He definitely did focus a little too heavily on Drake‚Äôs race, but honestly it was super funny hearing the repeated ‚Äòwhite boy‚Äôs on the track. And while the track itself was cool but not groundbreaking, that outro was genuinely amazing and one of the most hilarious things I‚Äôve heard in a long time. Plus there genuinely were some hard lines on the actual track. 

Final Grade: B


2. Push Ups - Now THIS, this right here is how you respond to a diss track. Drake managed to shut down every single jab on Like That in masterful fashion before going on to expose Kendrick being allegedly extorted by his label, and clown him for being a midget. All the while he managed to throw shots at Future, Weeknd, freaking Jah Morant and most notably Metro over a song that is going to get played in the club with a fun refrain. Loved the energy here from Drake. My only criticisms of the track are ones he couldn‚Äôt exactly control for.  Those being that he whule he neutralized a lot of Kendrick‚Äôs stuff he didn‚Äôt actually add much besides the extortion stuff with Top (which rings pretty hollow coming from Drake). I mean Drake didn‚Äôt really have time with how many people he had to address after all and the lines about his height were still pretty funny. Still a great diss track considering what he had to do during, but as you can probably tell by the spot I gave it, it was beatable for Dot. 

Final Grade: A-

1. Euphoria - Let me get the criticism out of the way first. Kendrick didn‚Äôt really say anything insane before the Melly line and the track covers publicly discussed topics. But holy crap this was a strong track. Everything from that Melly bar onwards was nasty. I don‚Äôt think I went four bars without a strong reaction from then on. Every topic that had been talked about previously was perfected by Kendrick here. From the way he tackled his identity issues to him being a snake he managed to phrase everything in a variety of vicious ways. Hell he even managed to flip the fact that he said nothing new into a body blow about Drake as a father.  I also feel like the replay value critique is overblown if not altogether false. While I‚Äôm not going to be bumping this as much as a Like That or a HISS or even a Push Ups, there are definitely a good amount of pretty nice quotables and that second beat is super fun.  Plus for me I‚Äôve been catching more bars on follow up listens to the point that I like it a lot more on my last listen then I did on my first. It‚Äôs also up there with Champagne Moments in terms of comedic value. It‚Äôs no Story of Adidon and he didn‚Äôt do any damage that‚Äôs irrecoverable, but Kendrick is definitely up for me right now. 

Final Grade: A

While pens are sharpened, hopefully by Kendrick, I share my impressions in hopes to trigger a debate:  
1) I never cared much about Drake, but his response made me acknowledge he has guts, especially considering he addressed those who have come to him in the last week (A$AP Rocky, Metro/Future, The Weekend) and others (namedropping Kendrick's wife Whitney, Top Dawg). Regardless if he recurs to ghostwriters or DM's rappers' companions (lame move, btw), he is willing to step to the occasion, and I respect that.  
2) After J. Cole regretting '7 Minute Drill' and removing it from streaming services, none of his bars throughout his catalog mean the same to me. I was thinking of 'Fire Squad' (*My uzi it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun / In fact I just might need two, cuz ni\*\*as say they the one / And I got something to prove*) is simply not backed up by his attitude. Yes, his apology is noble. As one person wrote, it is possible that he might have been aware of how Drake intended to respond and decided he was not willing to engage at that level and be away from that energy. Still, he had time to think while writing a response while awaiting mixing/mastering, but it just shows he gave way to peer pressure (My text flooded with the hunger for a toxic reply). In the end, his album release went into oblivion, and I'm not sure how it will stain his image as a leader for Dreamville. Seems Kendrick's ""*I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves / Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help.*"" stands true.  
3) It is sad how a large percentage of rap fans think in pop terms of sales/streaming numbers to determine who is better. It almost reminds me of Messi vs Cristiano Ronaldo's (sports terms) rivalry instead of appreciating the artistry behind it.  
4) A little off context, but it is crazy to me that this beef has become heated in a context of the world getting geopolitically tense (Israel/Palestine, Russia/Ukraine, recently Iran/Israel, etc.)",False,False,hiphop101,"After Drake's response release, what are your opinions of this ongoing beef in the rap scene?",0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphop101/comments/1c3g28r/after_drakes_response_release_what_are_your/

""the ones you getting your stories from, they all clowns""  
""we plotted for a week then fed you the information""

I don't know why i have to even explain this, its painful how illiterate the world has gotten. He is calling the person who fed kendrick the info a clown, as in the person THEY fed the info to. HE is a clown who believed them and is now feeding it to kendrick. He clowned them.

(PS i dont believe drake did feed the info, he jumped too fast into IG defensively to disprove it)

Drizzy is obviously aware that mother I sober isnt about kendrick getting molested. Its the trauma kendrick got from repeatedly having to deny he was molested and second guessing himself. Drake prefaces the line saying, youd rather misdirect shit, then does the exact same thing deliberately by claiming kendrick was molested. He's poking fun at kendricks trauma of always having to deny he was molested. It's like - okay you want to misdirect shit, allow me to as well and poke your sore spot and have you deny you were molested again.

""Like if Dave really fucked your girl and got her pregnant, talk about breedin' resentment""

Just a smart bar wanted to throw it in here

""Stop buyin' views and bot comments,¬†you may as well keep the paper  
Shit you 'bout to need for later""

There is undeniable proof kendrick has been purchasing bots and comments as part of a social media campaign on twitter but what I find interesting is this bar about keeping the paper because its shit hes gon need for later. It sounds like a threat of some sort and a warning kendrick is going to need to save his bread for something imminent.

""If you still bumping R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior  
Said if they deleted his music then your music is going too, a hypocrite""

Kendrick and his team blatantly said that if spotify pulls r kellys music, kendricks music is going as well. He's pointing out the hypocrisy. Tupac, Kodak, R kelly are all convicted rapist. All 3 of them kendrick has aligned himself with. Convicted as seen through the eyes of lady justice. Not whooplah, not word of mouth, not allegedly. They raped women and did time for it and kendrick has aligned himself with these men fully.

""Just let me know when we're gettin' to the facts

If you can't see that kendrick has taken an approach of throwing as many nasty bullshit allegations as he possibly can, one outdoing the other, in break neck speeds to avoid anyone questioning the validity of his claims, then you arnt looking at this unbiasly. I'm a drake fan first but i still give kendrick his roses, but the nonsense around the fanbases is hurting.

Using Tupac's and Snoop's AI voices was a direct reminder of what happens when an artist bucks the establishment. IT'S A BFD.

If using a deceased artist's voice or likeness after their death isn't making it clear that labels own said artist even then, I don't know what is. Just see what Snoop and Dre [approved](https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/16/2951750/coachella-tupac-performance-explanation-how-musion-mpc-peppers-ghost). The fact that Drake's ghost writers reference Kendrick's exploitive label deal in his disses further underlines this point.

Everything about Drake says he's heavily emeshed with the folks that control the industry. Culturally, they are similar to a clan. We see the same patterns play out: the old establishment grooms [lieutenants](https://images.app.goo.gl/V2iuFA8XeVj8jA5P7) as to how to exploit and blackmail folks into submission (all while cashing in and getting away with the sexual exploitation of vulnerable people). Those artists and change makers that refuse to fall in line meet the same fate as Tupac or Kennedy. We see the same patterns playing out in global politics, right now, as our policy makers are [beholden](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/house-vote-ukraine-israel-aid-johnson/) to 3rd party schemes.

*They have money for war, but can't feed the poor.*

That's why rappers don't trust Drake and assume ""safety in numbers"" in their approach.

Snoop didn't press use of his voice for a reason. He may not have been directly involved in Pac's demise, but he and Dre benefited. More than anything, Snoop knows how deep this goes and why to keep quiet. 

Just think of the ego between those two. They are young men in the same game but with wildly different talent, potential, and appeal. There are also rumors Pac was trying or punking Snoop (his [movements](https://youtu.be/Pv1kRwr4Sfw?si=w8qlHkeCGK0mz_OY) before and after 2Pac was shot speak for themselves). Think of it this simple way: in a room full of women, who would they flock to, Pac or [Snoop](https://images.app.goo.gl/35zA3qer3NAQqjNq7)? 

We see what Snoop did with his fame. He cashed in and got in line. Further, what Snoop [wore](https://youtu.be/VYFZFIZ5SBM?si=-j5ncO3i97f4w4WG) while accepting Pac's award at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is mad suspect. 

Coincidentally, conscious rap and rap that spoke about the liberation of oppressed communities, like the themes in Pac's work, never gained the same traction until... Kendrick. 

[All in line](https://www.hiphopisread.com/2012/04/secret-meeting-that-changed-rap-music.html) with the rumors we've heard for years: the industry also owns private prisons. Per [Cube](https://youtu.be/Ec6jeORp3GA?si=adte-9fjdmmzMBRj) and others, the industry benefits from the destabilization of the black community. Rappers as evident by Drake and/or [insert that one rapper that comes to your mind] don't have to be talented, just obedient and willing to deface and debase themselves for the all mighty dollar. The difference is that Drake has [house](https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.54360/title.dxclusive-universal-music-group-ceo-says-drake-has-an-unlimited-budget) privileges. 

The parallels between Kendrick and Pac are self-evident. 

Drake knows he can't compete on talent alone, so he reminded Kendrick et al. why he can't be trusted: because he is part of the establishment and he's backed by powerful industry daddies.

Right now Kendrick fans are speculating about him unearthing a conspiracy. They think he's on a righteous crusade. People are going through various companies he owns or is involved with, and bringing up the names of random people and making crazy connections. I guess we learned nothing about the Boston bomber debacle, maybe people don't remember.

On the Drake side of things, they're convinced it's an industry-wide effort to get rid of Drake, and are using gossip forums from 10 years ago as a way to prove Kendrick is abusive. They're also making insane connections and reading into lyrics that have them convinced he has been planning to expose him and others.

Drake might be a Weinstein-like personality, Kendrick might be an abusive husband. But the way people are digging to prove these allegations is wiiild. I bet I can pick a random celebrity, and a random allegation, and find random bits and pieces of information that seem to corroborate it. It's not difficult.

Social media is kind of insane. People forget these are human, neither of these guys is a saint. They might both be bad people. But the tinfoil hat shit is kind of crazy, dude.

He will not reply in a dedicated diss track. He was expecting Drake to be ""too big"" to get down and dirty and just throw a sub or two in a feature, so then he could release his album in May. Drake has had diss tracks dissing rappers even BEFORE signing with Wayne; people just seem to forget because Drake likes to sing and shit. 

I don't know why it was so hard to believe for many of you that Drake is 10x more battle-tested than Kendrick and Cole combined when the history and the proof are there. 

Kendrick has been very open with his relationship problems, especially in his last album and in push ups, how he went to therapy to deal with their issues etc. Drake's ""Bodyguard like Whitney"" line is sending him a message that he's willing to get personal and probably air out the rumors that Kendrick's wife cheated on him with his own bodyguard, and one of the kids might not even be his. We as listeners scuffle at it, but you think Kendrick would be willing to open another can of worms in his private life over a few lines in ""like that'? My answer is no. 

Losing to Drake is 10x worse than to another artist because his reach and fanbase is immense, one more devilish track airing some shit from your very private life won't be forgotten maybe ever. You'll be clowned forever.

But idk how else to ask my question, without sounding like a bait question. So sorry in advance!

This isn‚Äôt to say I don‚Äôt believe he is, Kendrick disses against Drake have echoed certain feelings I have towards Drake (as a black Canadian) that I haven‚Äôt been able to express in words lol. 

However, the video from the other day that was posted on the main subreddit going through Drakes old house got me wondering. It‚Äôs always been said that Drake was the biggest rap fanboy, when he was younger. Just a huge nerd for rap basically. It seems to me that he does have a lot of genuine love for the genre, or at least he did at that time. 

The responses I‚Äôve seen have people explain that he‚Äôs a culture vulture because he‚Äôs fake and lies about his raps, not being himself. Which I 100% agree, and this isn‚Äôt a defence of his behaviour, or trying to deflect using whataboutism (at least I hope I‚Äôm not). 

But I‚Äôm wondering how is this much more different than other rappers who also lie about being in gangs, murdering people, and committing crimes. When they‚Äôve themselves never done it?

I know these people get called out too, but it‚Äôs not to the same degree so I‚Äôm just trying to understand the perspective more. In my head the idea of a culture vulture is someone who has no understanding, appreciation, or respect for the culture, and uses it to their own benefit. Like those right wing ‚Äúrappers‚Äù like Tom McDonald for example. 

I‚Äôm just trying to understand the greater context because it feels like it‚Äôs going over my head. I‚Äôd appreciate the explanation. In my mind I‚Äôve view Drake as someone who lies in his rap, and his background, but he‚Äôs also a huge rap nerd and Ive noticed that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so sensitive towards the OG‚Äôs criticizing him in contrast to other people because of how much he looked up to them. 


I think he‚Äôs a terrible person at his core, and I do believe the pedo stuff tbh. But I‚Äôm more specifically wondering about the culture vulture aspect, and what differentiates him lying from others that lie in their music?

Rock still exists today but it's just out of the spotlight and not nearly as big.

With hip hop I can kind of see it going in the same direction. It has been over 10 years since Kanye, Drake, Cole, Kendrick came onto the scene and there haven't been any rappers since then that have reached their level of success. Nor is there any promising young rappers with potential to be the next big superstar.

**If anyone sticks around to the end to read all this shit, if you have any comments on what I missed or should be edited, lmk. Also go touch grass.**

\* October 2023: Cole/Drake dropped First Person Shooter, which sees Drake take shots at Kenny and while he gives props to the Big 3, Cole also claims he‚Äôs the best rapper alive. The verse from Cole is a bit disingenuous, calling themselves the Big 3, but referring to himself as Ali and saying ""me and Drizzy shits like the Super Bowl,"" which in turn refers to KDot as the third best in the group. Also calls himself ""Muhammed Ali,"" who is considered the greatest to ever do it. In Jermaine's eyes, its Cole Drake Kenny.

\* March 2024: Metro Boomin (rap producer) and Future drop ‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Trust You,‚Äù an album which sees them take multiple shots at Drake. One song (Like that) features Kendrick, who is practically inviting him to throw gloves with Drake (and Cole). Responds to the Big 3 claims with ""Fuck the Big 3, it's just Big Me."" A lot of his verse is going at Drake directly, calling his best work a ""Lyt pack,"" and playing up the MJ Prince comps with the ""Prince outlived Mike Jack"" bar.

(The Drake Metro beef goes back a bit. Drake wanted to be on Metro's album on the song 'Trance,' but Metro didn't like what Drake had submitted. Drake also submitted his verse late, which pissed off Metro, who ended up removing Drake's verse and keeping him off the album entirely. Drake does not take this news kindly, and ends up leaking his verse, which pisses Metro off further. He goes on a twitter rant, stating why Drake doesn't deserve a Grammy. When 21 Savage dropped his album ""American Dream"", Drake congratulated him on Insta, with a Screenshot that omitted Metro's name out of the credits. Which leads to Metro dropping ""We Don't Trust You"" and ""Like That"" as a result.)

Thank you u/[CROW\_is\_best](https://www.reddit.com/user/CROW_is_best/) 

\* Two weeks later: Cole drops Might Delete Later, a 12 song EP. The last song (7 minute drill) is his response to Kendrick. However fans were pretty critical of his reply, with some claiming that as a diss it was pretty tame at best. Other fans claimed it was just a warning shot, and that it wasn't meant to be a diss back. A few days later, Cole apologized to Kendrick at Dreamville fest, and backed out of the battle. It is rumored that TDE member Schoolboy Q advised Cole to drop out of the beef, as it was between Kendrick/Drake, and it would get more personal.

\* April 2024: 3 weeks after ‚ÄúLike That‚Äù, Metro and Future drop another album, ‚ÄúWe STILL Don‚Äôt Trust You."" This album features multiple artists who also throw disses at Drake. ASAP Rocky for dissing his BM, Weeknd calling out ""leaks in the operation.""

\* A day after Metro/Future drop their 2nd album, Drake's ‚ÄúPush Ups‚Äù leaks online. This song clapped back at everyone that took shots at him on We don‚Äôt trust you, from Kendrick to Rick Ross to ASAP to Metro to Weeknd. In the song, Drake makes fun of Kendrick‚Äôs height, shoe size, his label split (supposedly he had to give TDE 50 of his publishing), and had a subtle jab at Kendrick‚Äôs wife Whitney.

\* Drake also dropped a song that featured an AI voice of Tupac (Kendrick‚Äôs idol) and Snoop Dogg. Both west coast legends, but encouraging Kendrick to drop and stop being scared. A controversial track that was polarizing to say the least. Some fans praising its creativity in the rap beef, along with great verses from Drake. Others calling it disrespectful to a rap legend, and a bad precedent to allow AI in music. The Tupac estate ended up sending a C&D to Drake, who later removed the song from all socials.

(Note that here the public perception was for Kendrick to drop a reply, that Drake had come back correct with Push Ups and that if Kendrick was going to start a battle, he shouldn't duck when met with a reply)

\* Two weeks after ‚ÄúPush Ups:"" Kendrick drops ‚ÄúEuphoria,‚Äù which goes in on Drakes parenting ability, legitimacy in the rap game, and so on. A very solid dissection into the man we know as Drake, its a very good diss track that shows Kendrick's lyricism in full display. Also acknowledged that the industry is out to get Drake ""wtf is this a 20v1,"" and told Metro to ""shut yo hoe ass up and make some drums.""

(He replied to this with an IG story of a merengue remix of that Metro bar, which was hilarious lmao. That and the band peforming outside Magic City in ATL were the funniest parts of the beef)

\* A few days after, he followed up with ‚Äú6:16 in LA"" on Instagram. Not really a diss track in my opinion, it felt more like a track that had some warnings to Drake. Dot questions the loyalty of OVO and their legitimacy in the group, planting seeds of doubt in the mind of Drake.  The cover this song is a black Maybach glove.

\* Drake replied with ‚ÄúFamily Matters‚Äù later that night, claiming Kendrick as a phony, attention whore, and worst of all a wife beater. Also claims that Dave Free (Kendrick‚Äôs manager), is the father of one of his kids. He drops this song with a full on music video, crushing the GKMC van, showing off the jewelry of rap legends like Pharrell and Pac, and so on.

(Honestly some of Drake's best work, and fans see it as such. Honestly some of his best writing since at least IYRTITL. That along with the beats make it a top 10 Drake song in my opinion. Some claim it's the best song in the diss. However, I just don't see it, for the reason I'm mentioning below:)

\* Not even half an hour later: Kendrick drops ‚Äúmeet the grahams‚Äù which has heavy accusations. The cover of this song contains some of Drake's items. It includes: Ozempic/Adderrall/Zolpidem prescriptions, a receipt for the chains that Drake bought, presumably the ones in the FM video, and a visit card. Song claims Drake is a terrible person, has pedophilic thoughts/tendencies, runs a underground sex ring, and has a daughter that he‚Äôs hiding who‚Äôs at least 11 yrs old. It is a haunting track that sees Alchemist produce the beat.

(In my opinion, the clear turning point of this battle. For Kendrick to drop the time that it did, took the wind out of the sails that was Family Matters. And did it at a time where EVERYONE was reacting to it in real time. If the track didn't hit as hard as it did, it probably does not have an impact and Drake would have been the winner. Which is why IMO it's the best diss song in the battle. Despite the fact that daughter claims are mere allegations, he hit home on every other point that was made, with the cover art being proof of his verses holding truth. Which can't be said about any other diss in this battle, bar Euphoria.)

\* He then dropped ‚ÄúNot Like Us‚Äù a day after FM/Meet the Grahams, which doubles down on the pedo claims, and also calls him a colonizer. This song is an instant hit and a West Coast banger, as it is currently the top song on the Billboard 200 as of the time writing this post.

(This song shifted the tide to ""Drake is cooked"" status. Prior to this song, people were still reeling from the back to back disses and asking that both sides bring receipts to the table. But with Not Like Us being a colossal hit, fans flocked to Kendrick's side. This track felt like the equivalent to a 3rd quarter run from the 2017 Warriors. Once it happens, you're done.)

To make matters worse, Metro also dropped a disstrumental called ""BBL Drizzy,"" encouraging fans to drop a verse on the song, giving the winner 10k and a free Metro beat.

(Also a pivotal moment. If Drake wasn't losing the battle before, he lost the internet game with this combo. Now social media was clowning on him)

\* A day later, Drake replied with ""The Heart Part 6,"" a play on the The Heart series that Kendrick Lamar has. This song sees Drake claim that he set Kendrick up with fake information, and planted all this from the start. He also continues to apply pressure on the DV claims, and dispells the accusations made against him about him being a pedo. Also claims that he understands why Kendrick is so pent up, as Drake believes that Kendrick got molested as a child, referencing ""Mother I Sober."" Fans believe this track was a white flag of sorts, with the bars saying ""You could drop a hundred more records, I'll see you later,"" and:

""That's why these pedophile raps and shit you so obsessed with, it's so excessive  
They actin' like it's so aggressive, but you just never known affection  
I don't wanna diss you anymore, this really got me second-guessin.""

The last bar seems to question Kendrick's motives in the beef, and that Drake wants no parts in a battle that is really just projecting trauma. Regardless, the song was met with criticism for questionable lyrics and disses in the song. Shortly after, both sides alluded to move on, with Punch/Top of TDE declaring Kendrick the winner, and Drake saying ""Good Battle, summer vibes up next,"" with the beef ending there.",False,False,hiphop101,Ignore this post if you want,0.25,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphop101/comments/1cvogpp/ignore_this_post_if_you_want/

A man that raps that well clearly knows what he‚Äôs talking about. Again, Joes rap ability testifies to his understanding of rap. The people that hate Drake, have you ever recorded a song or wrote a rap? A good one at that? One that Jay-Z would respect you for?? We call you haters because it‚Äôs clear to anyone with two ears and common sense that Drake raps very well. Even Kanye said it and HE HATES DRAKE! It‚Äôs so many people in the industry that have actual credentials and earned the right to have an opinion that vouch for his talent. Common Sense, someone else that beefed with Drake and is a pure Hip-Hop legend! EVEN KENDRICK SAID IT!

 If you don‚Äôt think he writes it himself that‚Äôs fine  but acting like the bars aren‚Äôt there is asinine and more of an indictment on your competentcy. Listen to the pod for yourself.

We like to pretend beef is ‚Äòdestroy or be destroyed‚Äô but in reality the damage is fairly superficial.

Drake fans will continue loving Drake - he‚Äôs faced comments about his race, his being an actor, being corny for many years. 

Kendrick‚Äôs track Euphoria was great but it won‚Äôt amount to anything more than the segment of fans who care saying this or that rapper won. Nothing more.

Considering Kanye wasn‚Äôt cancelled for his anti semitism - the bar is seriously high for reputational damage to mean anything anymore

Kendrick needs to follow up giving actual receipts on Drake being a pedo and R Kelly him thereby ending his career or Drake wins the war. I don't think Kendrick has that, it's all speculation

If he doesn't have that then the situation is that Kendrick made a bunch of tryhard rappity-rap songs one after another with weird vocal inflections sounding like Hopsin acting mad asf for no reason torpedoing his nice-guy image forever and Drake is still left standing. He'll forever have the W that the so-called god of rap in the new millennium did everything he could to take him down and failed

Drake is corny and sus yeah. Always has been, always been known, and yet he still runs hip hop. When Kendrick finishes getting all his shit off Drake will make more catchy Back to Back type songs flexing like he still runs it and he'll be right

On the other hand, Kendrick has more to lose with his posture. His career is kind of going nowhere atp and he has this whole pseudo-activist ""black messiah"" image that is pretty fragile at this point. Reaching for homophobia and weird racism saying Drake can't work with Atlanta artists because he's light skinned, making up fake allegations (Drake is making up fake allegations too but still) is a weird look for him

It is sad because it was fun at first seeing all these diss tracks back and forth and being excited on what each rapper is going to respond next. But now after The Heart Part 6, both sides just stopped, as the beef just stopped out of nowhere (it has been a week since The Heart Part 6 dropped btw). Kendrick just put some bombshell allegations on Drake, so harsh that it made Drake hide and let Kendrick just win. But what really killed it is Rubi Rose and cancel culture. Firstly, this is in no need a defense as for some of them (Travis especially) they def were a weird. But what made me say is that everyone went on a witch hunt to cancel any rapper in any sort of way related to Rubi Rose back when she was minor (which was before 2015) assuming they dated her. It just morphed the already concerning allegations first brought up by Kendrick to a whole cesspool where every no life basement dweller with a twitter account is going way back to find any ""evidence"" to cancel any rapper of being weirdos. I genuinely thought cancel culture died back in 2020, but no, it never did. 

Also, Rubi Rose has been deleting old tweets regarding the situation happening. She could be doing that just so she could save her skin (like if she wasn't lying about her age to get with old, and she thinks it gives her immunity of criticism by pulling the minor card)

The more Drake doesn‚Äôt respond, and the more other random people ‚Äújump‚Äù on him, the more sympathy he gets. Check out the shade rooms latest post on Drake and Pissa T. You‚Äôll see that everybody is dragging pissa T and saying Drake is innocent. People finally realizing Metro is a cornball. And if Kendrick drops a full diss to Drake, it will be the same thing. Drake should continue to let these fools empty their clips, so to speak, so that when he finally does respond, it will hit so much harder. We know Drake is well versed in the art of war, this is just part of the game plan. Everybody loves a him vs everybody story and they will root for Drake if this continues. 

The only reason hardcore hip hop fans won‚Äôt is because they hate Drake and everything he does. They wouldn‚Äôt be on his side no matter what, so their thoughts don‚Äôt mean much. Drakes FANS will get the winning narrative by the time this is over. And by winning narrative this is what I mean: 

- Drake is more successful and metro is attaching himself to him for clout
- Drake made Future‚Äôs career and gave him his biggest hits/album
- Drake gave Rick Ross his biggest hit
- Drake is the BIGGEST of them all and will continue to be despite the outcome of this beef 
- niggas so scared of him they had to assemble a team to come at him, they didn‚Äôt wanna get meek mill‚Äôd 
- Kendrick is mid and jealous of drakes success and height
